		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Characteristics and viral propagation properties of a new human diploid cell line, Walvax-2, and its suitability as a candidate cell substrate for vaccine production.</p>
<p>“We have developed a new HDCS, Walvax-2, which we derived from the lung tissue of a 3-month-old fetus.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/25803132/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/25803132/</a></p>

<span class="study"></span> Epidemiologic and Molecular Relationship Between Vaccine Manufacture and Autism Spectrum Disorder Prevalence.
<p>“Vaccines manufactured in human fetal cell lines contain unacceptably high levels of fetal DNA fragment contaminants. The human genome naturally contains regions that are susceptible to double strand break formation and DNA insertional mutagenesis.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/26103708/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/26103708/</a></p>
<hr />
<span class="study"></span> Fetal tissue research: an ongoing story of professionally responsible success.
<p>“Research using fetal tissue has allowed for development of vaccines for numerous diseases including polio, rubella, and measles.”</p>
<p>“These scientific and medical advances are dependent on the use of fetal tissue from aborted fetuses. While the practice of induced abortion despite societal benefit may be theologically objectionable to some, these practices are professionally responsible. Federal regulations exist to discourage patients from being influenced by the societal benefit of fetal research in arriving at the decision to terminate as well as to prevent researchers from influencing a patient’s decision.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/26432465" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/26432465</a></p>
<hr />
<span class="study"></span> [Vaccines, biotechnology and their connection with induced abortion].
<p>“Diploid cells (WI-38, MRC-5) vaccines have their origin in induced abortions. Among these vaccines we find the following: rubella, measles, mumps, rabies, polio, smallpox, hepatitis A, chickenpox, and herpes zoster. Nowadays, other abortion tainted vaccines cultivated on transformed cells (293, PER.C6) are in the pipeline: flu, Respiratory Syncytial and parainfluenza viruses, HIV, West Nile virus, Ebola, Marburg and Lassa, hepatitis B and C, foot and mouth disease, Japanese encephalitis, dengue, tuberculosis, anthrax, plague, tetanus and malaria. The same method is used for the production of monoclonal antibodies and other proteins, gene therapy and genomics. Technology enables us to develop the aforementioned products without resorting to induced abortion. Full disclosure of the cell origin in the labelling of vaccines and other products must be supported. There are vaccines from non-objectionable sources which should be made available to the public. When no alternative vaccines exist, ethical research must be promoted. Non-objectionable sources in the production of monoclonal antibodies, gene therapy and genomics must be encouraged. It is not be consistent to abstain from products originated in embryonic stem cells and at the same time approve of products obtained from induced abortions. It is of paramount importance to avoid that induced abortion technology seeps into every field of Medicine.”</p>

 <h4>Estimating the extent of vaccine-derived poliovirus infection.</h4>
<p>"Eight outbreaks of paralytic polio attributable to circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) have highlighted the risks associated with oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) use in areas of low vaccination coverage and poor hygiene."</p>
<p>"Although only 114 virologically-confirmed paralytic cases were identified in the eight cVDPV outbreaks, it is likely that a minimum of hundreds of thousands, and more likely several million individuals were infected during these events, and that many thousands more have been infected by VDPV lineages within outbreaks which have escaped detection.</p>

    <h4>Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis After Influenza Vaccination: A Case Report</h4>
    <p>"Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis developed in a 42-year-old woman within 3 weeks of receiving the seasonal influenza vaccine. She had 80% recovery after 3 months of treatment with methylprednisolone. Although cases of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis after vaccination for influenza are rare, enough of them have occurred that critical care nurses should be aware of the possibility. Early treatment can prevent serious residual signs and symptoms; therefore, correct and quick diagnosis is important. Medical history obtained from patients with central nervous system problems should include history of recent vaccinations."</p>

    <h4>Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis after tetanus vaccination of a pregnant woman in Senegal</h4>
    <p>"Although neurological complications have been described after tetanus vaccinations, they are rare. The authors report a case of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) in a 28-year-old pregnant woman at a gestational age of 10 weeks, admitted 15 days after a tetanus vaccination, with spastic tetraplegia and sphincter disturbances. Corticosteroid treatment led to partial recovery of the neurological deficit. Differential diagnosis of infectious and demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system is difficult in view of clinical and laboratory aspects of post-vaccination ADEM. Without any specific diagnostic markers, the clinical examination, magnetic resonance imaging and negative etiological findings were key to this diagnosis. Medical staff must bear in mind the possible complications of this vaccine."</p>

    <p>"A 27-year-old woman presented with acute paresis after taking an oral polio vaccine (OPV). Deep tendon reflexes were preserved, needle electromyography showed no neurogenic changes, and there were no lesions on spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), suggesting that motor neurons of the spinal cord were not affected. Brain MRI showed abnormal lesions in the tegmentum of the upper pons, left cerebral peduncles, truncus of the corpus callosum, and right parietal lobe. Cerebrospinal fluid revealed mild pleocytosis. The most probable diagnosis was acute disseminated encephalomyelitis associated with OPV."</p>

<p>“AIM: Allergies to hen’s egg and cow’s milk are the most frequent food allergies in infancy and childhood. Current guidelines recommend safe administration of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine in egg allergic patients.</p>
<p>METHODS: We present three cases of anaphylaxis that we encountered after MMR vaccination in children sensitized to hen’s egg and cow’s milk.</p>
<p>RESULTS: Even though MMR vaccine is generally known to be safe in children with egg allergy, there may still be isolated cases of anaphylaxis.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION: Therefore, we recommend that all children not only those who were sensitized to foods should receive the MMR vaccination in a setting that is equipped to deal with anaphylactic reactions. As stated by WHO in immunization safety surveillance, ‘Each vaccinator must have an emergency kit with adrenaline, and be familiar with its dosage and administration’.

Aluminum in the central nervous system (CNS): toxicity in humans and animals, vaccine adjuvants, and autoimmunity.
“We have examined the neurotoxicity of aluminum in humans and animals under various conditions, following different routes of administration, and provide an overview of the various associated disease states. The literature demonstrates clearly negative impacts of aluminum on the nervous system across the age span. In adults, aluminum exposure can lead to apparently age-related neurological deficits resembling Alzheimer’s and has been linked to this disease and to the Guamanian variant, ALS-PDC. Similar outcomes have been found in animal models. In addition, injection of aluminum adjuvants in an attempt to model Gulf War syndrome and associated neurological deficits leads to an ALS phenotype in young male mice. In young children, a highly significant correlation exists between the number of pediatric aluminum-adjuvanted vaccines administered and the rate of autism spectrum disorders. Many of the features of aluminum-induced neurotoxicity may arise, in part, from autoimmune reactions, as part of the ASIA syndrome.”

Biopersistence and Brain Translocation of Aluminum Adjuvants of Vaccines
Concerns about the use of aluminum adjuvants have emerged following (i) recognition of their role at the origin of the so-called macrophagic myofasciitis (MMF) lesion in 2001 (3, 4), which revealed fundamental misconception of their adjuvant effect and pointed out their unexpectedly long-lasting biopersistence (4); and (ii) demonstration of their apparent capacity to migrate in lymphoid organs and then disseminate throughout the body within monocyte-lineage cells and progressively accumulate in the brain (5).

Effect of concurrent chronic exposure of fluoride and aluminum on rat brain.
Kaur T, et al. Drug Chem Toxicol. 2009.
“The present in vivo study was designed to investigate the toxic potential of fluoride alone and in conjugation with aluminum on the rat brain. The region-specific response of both elements was studied in different regions of brain, namely the cerebrum, cerebellum, and medulla oblongata. Following fluoride exposure, oxidative stress increased significantly, estimated by increased lipid peroxidation and a decrease in the activity of the antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase. The neurotransmitter (e.g., dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin) content was also altered. However, these aspects were more pronounced in animals given fluoride and aluminum together. Histological evidence showed deprivation of neuronal integrity with higher magnitude in concurrent fluoride and aluminum exposure, as compared to fluoride alone. Thus, it can be concluded that aluminum appears to enhance the neurotoxic hazards caused by fluoride.”

Macrophagic myofasciitis associated with vaccine-derived aluminium.
“Macrophagic myofasciitis is characterised by sheets of macrophages in striated muscle, a few lymphocytes and inconspicuous muscle fibre damage. It is due to aluminium contained in vaccines, and is localised to the inoculation site. We report the first Australian case, detected incidentally when investigating a raised serum creatine kinase level.”

Occurrence of severe destructive lyme arthritis in hamsters vaccinated with outer surface protein A and challenged with Borrelia burgdorferi.
“When the canine rOspA vaccine was combined with aluminum hydroxide, all vaccinated hamsters developed arthritis after challenge with B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. Histopathologic examination confirmed the development of severe destructive arthritis in rOspA-vaccinated hamsters challenged with B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. These findings suggest that rOspA vaccines should be modified to eliminate epitopes of OspA responsible for the induction of arthritis. Our results are important because an rOspA vaccine in aluminum hydroxide was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in humans.”

🛑 A possible central mechanism in autism spectrum disorders, part 1.
“The autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of related neurodevelopmental disorders that have been increasing in incidence since the 1980s. Despite a considerable amount of data being collected from cases, a central mechanism has not been offered. A careful review of ASD cases discloses a number of events that adhere to an immunoexcitotoxic mechanism. This mechanism explains the link between excessive vaccination, use of aluminum and ethylmercury as vaccine adjuvants, food allergies, gut dysbiosis, and abnormal formation of the developing brain. It has now been shown that chronic microglial activation is present in autistic brains from age 5 years to age 44 years. A considerable amount of evidence, both experimental and clinical, indicates that repeated microglial activation can initiate priming of the microglia and that subsequent stimulation can produce an exaggerated microglial response that can be prolonged. It is also known that one phenotypic form of microglia activation can result in an outpouring of neurotoxic levels of the excitotoxins, glutamate and quinolinic acid. Studies have shown that careful control of brain glutamate levels is essential to brain pathway development and that excesses can result in arrest of neural migration, as well as dendritic and synaptic loss. It has also been shown that certain cytokines, such as TNF-alpha, can, via its receptor, interact with glutamate receptors to enhance the neurotoxic reaction. To describe this interaction I have coined the term immunoexcitotoxicity, which is described in this article.”

Prolonged exposure to low levels of aluminum leads to changes associated with brain aging and neurodegeneration.
“Epidemiological studies suggest that aluminum may not be as innocuous as was previously thought and that aluminum may actively promote the onset and progression of Alzheimer’s disease.”

Serious adverse events after HPV vaccination: a critical review of randomized trials and post-marketing case series.
Martínez-Lavín M, et al. Clin Rheumatol. 2017.
“This article critically reviews HPV vaccine serious adverse events described in pre-licensure randomized trials and in post-marketing case series. HPV vaccine randomized trials were identified in PubMed. Safety data were extracted. Post-marketing case series describing HPV immunization adverse events were reviewed. Most HPV vaccine randomized trials did not use inert placebo in the control group. Two of the largest randomized trials found significantly more severe adverse events in the tested HPV vaccine arm of the study. Compared to 2871 women receiving aluminum placebo, the group of 2881 women injected with the bivalent HPV vaccine had more deaths on follow-up (14 vs. 3, p = 0.012). Compared to 7078 girls injected with the 4-valent HPV vaccine, 7071 girls receiving the 9-valent dose had more serious systemic adverse events (3.3 vs. 2.6%, p = 0.01). For the 9-valent dose, our calculated number needed to seriously harm is 140 (95% CI, 796-53). The number needed to vaccinate is 1757 (95% CI, 131 to infinity). Practically, none of the serious adverse events occurring in any arm of both studies were judged to be vaccine-related. Pre-clinical trials, post-marketing case series, and the global drug adverse reaction database (VigiBase) describe similar post-HPV immunization symptom clusters. Two of the largest randomized HPV vaccine trials unveiled more severe adverse events in the tested HPV vaccine arm of the study. Nine-valent HPV vaccine has a worrisome number needed to vaccinate/number needed to harm quotient. Pre-clinical trials and post-marketing case series describe similar post-HPV immunization symptoms.”

Vaccine-related serious adverse events might have been under-recognized in the pivotal HPV vaccine randomized trial (2017)
“To the Editor:
After seeing several healthy girls developing a severe chronic illness soon after HPV vaccination [1], I analyzed all HPV vaccine randomized controlled trials.
The overwhelming majority of pre-licensure HPV vaccine randomized trials did not use inert placebo as comparator. The largest nine-valent HPV immunization trial [2] compared the newly developed nine-valent HPV vaccine vs. the four-valent HPV formulation. The innovative nine-valent HPV dose has more than double HPV virus-like particles and aluminum adjuvant than the previous formulation. Double-blind safety analysis contrasted 7071 subjects immunized with the nine-valent vaccine vs. 7078 who had the four-valent dose. The nine-valent cohort had significantly more systemic serious adverse events; n = 233 (3.3%) vs. n = 183 (2.6%) in the other group. Our calculated 2 × 2 contingency table pvalue was 0.0125. Oddly, only two subjects (0%) in each group were judged to have a vaccine-related serious adverse event. The authors did not comment on this incongruity.
This discrepancy arising from a pivotal large randomized double-blind trial suggests that nine-valent HPV vaccine-related serious adverse events were under-recognized. This emerging information casts further doubt on HPV vaccine safety.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Increased blood mercury levels in patients with Alzheimer’s disease.</h4>

<p>“Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that leads to dementia and death. In addition to several genetic parameters, various environmental factors may influence the risk of getting AD. In order to test whether blood levels of the heavy metal mercury are increased in AD, we measured blood mercury concentrations in AD patients (n = 33), and compared them to age-matched control patients with major depression (MD) (n = 45), as well as to an additional control group of patients with various non-psychiatric disorders (n = 65). Blood mercury levels were more than two-fold higher in AD patients as compared to both control groups (p = 0.0005, and p = 0.0000, respectively). In early onset AD patients (n = 13), blood mercury levels were almost three-fold higher as compared to controls (p = 0.0002, and p = 0.0000, respectively). These increases were unrelated to the patients’ dental status. Linear regression analysis of blood mercury concentrations and CSF levels of amyloid beta-peptide (A beta) revealed a significant correlation of these measures in AD patients (n = 15, r = 0.7440, p = 0.0015, Pearson type of correlation). These results demonstrate elevated blood levels of mercury in AD, and they suggest that this increase of mercury levels is associated with high CSF levels of A beta, whereas tau levels were unrelated. Possible explanations of increased blood mercury levels in AD include yet unidentified environmental sources or release from brain tissue with the advance in neuronal death.”

<h4>Prolonged exposure to low levels of aluminum leads to changes associated with brain aging and neurodegeneration.</h4>

<p>“Epidemiological studies suggest that aluminum may not be as innocuous as was previously thought and that aluminum may actively promote the onset and progression of Alzheimer’s disease.”

<h4>Vaccination to Alzheimer Disease. Is it a Promising Tool or a Blind Way?</h4>

Anaphylactic reactions to measles-mumps-rubella vaccine in three children with allergies to hen’s egg and cow’s milk.
“AIM: Allergies to hen’s egg and cow’s milk are the most frequent food allergies in infancy and childhood. Current guidelines recommend safe administration of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine in egg allergic patients.
METHODS: We present three cases of anaphylaxis that we encountered after MMR vaccination in children sensitized to hen’s egg and cow’s milk.
RESULTS: Even though MMR vaccine is generally known to be safe in children with egg allergy, there may still be isolated cases of anaphylaxis.
CONCLUSION: Therefore, we recommend that all children not only those who were sensitized to foods should receive the MMR vaccination in a setting that is equipped to deal with anaphylactic reactions. As stated by WHO in immunization safety surveillance, ‘Each vaccinator must have an emergency kit with adrenaline, and be familiar with its dosage and administration’.

Anaphylaxis after zoster vaccine: Implicating alpha-gal allergy as a possible mechanism.
“Gelatin and other nonprimate mammal–derived products are common excipient ingredients in several vaccines, and it has been postulated that patients with alpha-gal allergy might react to these vaccines.”

Anaphylaxis following single component measles and rubella immunisation.
“Anaphylaxis as an adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) is a rare occurrence. We report four cases of anaphylaxis following administration of single component measles or rubella vaccine between January 2003 and June 2007. We estimate that the incidence of anaphylaxis to measles and rubella single component vaccines is 18.9 and 22.4 cases/100,000 doses, respectively. These figures are likely to be an underestimate but are higher than expected. Our calculations were hampered by lack of immunisation reporting data from the private sector. We recommend that NHS standards of vaccine data reporting are also applied to private clinics.”

“The DTwP vaccine exhibited the highest rate of adverse events. Common minor events were: fever (17,538), reactions at injection site (4470) and systemic side effects (2422). Rare events (by WHO definition) reported were: persistent crying (2666), hypotonic-hyporesponsive episodes (3), encephalopathy (2) and febrile seizures (112). Severe events included: anaphylaxis (2), respiratory distress (1), multiple organ failure (1), sudden death (1), vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (2), toxic shock syndrome (3), and sepsis (1). The 10 deaths and 3 cases of disability were investigated by an expert commission, which concluded that 8 of the 13 severe events were vaccination-related.”

A case of Evans’ syndrome following influenza vaccine.
“CASE REPORT: A 50-year-old man with no prior medical history developed Evans’ syndrome 4 days after receiving influenza immunization. The patient improved following treatment with oral prednisone and intravenous immunoglobulin.
CONCLUSION: Influenza vaccine is one of the most commonly used vaccines worldwide, with millions of people being vaccinated annually. Despite its wide use, only sparse information has been published concerning any hematological effects of this vaccine. The rarity of such effects supports the safety of using this vaccine.”

Delayed life-threatening reaction to anthrax vaccine.
“CASE REPORT: We report a delayed and potentially serious life-threatening adverse reaction to anthrax vaccine. A previously healthy 34-year-old male was transported to the emergency department with dyspnea, diaphoresis, pallor, and urticarial wheals on his face, arms, and torso after the administration of the third dose of anthrax vaccine. All symptoms resolved after pharmacological intervention and the patient was discharged. Pharmaco-epidemiological data indicate that 30% of anthrax vaccine recipients experience mild local reactions. With large numbers of military personnel being vaccinated, emergency physicians may encounter more vaccine-related adverse reactions.”

ð Informed consent and investigational new drug abuses in the U.S. military. 2002 
“The DoD is currently using an approved drug, the anthrax vaccine, for an unapproved purpose and in an unapproved manner. In doing so, the DoD is not only violating the FDAâs regulations against such practices, it is also violating an executive order which only allows the president to authorize the use of INDs on service members without their consent.”

Adjuvants- and vaccines-induced autoimmunity: animal models.
“In some cases, adjuvants may trigger generalized autoimmune response, resulting in multiple auto-antibodies, but sometimes they can reproduce human autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren syndrome, autoimmune thyroiditis and antiphospholipid syndrome and may provide insights about the potential adverse effects of adjuvants.”

Autoimmune/auto-inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA) after quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccination in Colombians: a call for personalised medicine.
“This was a case study in which 3 patients with autoimmune/auto-inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA) after quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccination (HPV) were evaluated and described. All the patients were women. Diagnosis consisted of HLA-B27 enthesitis related arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematous, respectively. Our results highlight the risk of developing ASIA after HPV vaccination and may serve to increase the awareness of such a complication. Factors that are predictive of developing autoimmune diseases should be examined at the population level in order to establish preventive measures in at-risk individuals for whom healthcare should be personalized and participatory.”

A case-control study of quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine-associated autoimmune adverse events.
“It was observed that cases with the SAAE outcomes of gastroenteritis (odds ratio (OR) = 4.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.3-18.5), arthritis (OR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.4-4.3), systemic lupus erythematosus (OR = 5.3, 95% CI = 1.5-20.5), vasculitis (OR = 4, 95% CI = 1.01-16.4), alopecia (OR = 8.3, 95% CI = 4.5-15.9), or CNS conditions (OR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.04-2.9) were significantly more likely than controls to have received HPV4 vaccine (median onset of SAAE symptoms from 6 to 55 days post-HPV4 vaccination).”

A case of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) following Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination.
“A 15-year-old young woman received the Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines. Following the second HPV vaccination, intermittent fever, myalgia, arthritis and malar rash developed, and she was admitted to our hospital. Laboratory studies showed positive results for antinuclear antibody, anti-dsDNA antibody and anti-Sm antibody. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was diagnosed according to the Systemic Lupus International Collaborative Clinics 2012. Magnetic resonance imaging showed abnormal hyperintense areas in the fascia, and en bloc biopsy showed fasciitis. Treatment with prednisolone resulted in an amelioration of the symptoms. Reportedly, SLE developed after HPV vaccinations in some patients. Most such patients have a past or family history of autoimmune disease and presented SLE symptoms after the second vaccination. We describe herein a patient in whom SLE developed in association with HPV vaccination.”

Mycobacterial Arthritis at 19 Months After a Bacille Calmette-Guérin Vaccination. (2017)
“A 20-month-old afebrile boy living in northern Taiwan presented with swelling of the right knee for 5 days. No other respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms were associated. A bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccination had been performed when he was 1 month of age. The X-ray showed no bony destruction, and the sonography revealed some fluid accumulation in the right suprapatellar pouch. Arthrocentesis was performed, and characteristically cream-colored pus was drained (Figure 1 ). The knee swelling persisted, and magnetic resonance imaging showed abscess formation in the right suprapatellar bursa (Figures 2 and ​and33 ). Furthermore, surgical debridement was performed, and histological examination revealed granulomatous inflammation with caseation necrosis. The pus culture yielded Mycobacterium bovis. The patient was immunocompetent and was administered with isoniazid and rifampicin. He recovered without complications.
Tuberculosis remains an important health threat and the live attenuated BCG vaccine was used to prevent childhood tuberculosis. In 2009, the annual incidence of tuberculosis in Taiwan was approximately 69 cases/100,000 persons, and the Tokyo-172 BCG vaccination was included in the national immunization program with a coverage rate of 97%.1,2 BCG-related arthritis and osteitis is a rare but severe complication.3 The lower extremities are most commonly involved.4 The estimated incidence rates of BCG-related osteitis/osteomyelitis vary with place, time, and vaccine strain; for example, two cases per million vaccinations in Japan and 30 cases per million vaccinations in Finland.4,5 In Taiwan, the incidence was 12.9 cases per million vaccinations during 2005–2007.2 Pediatricians should remain alert for mycobacterial infections in children with BCG vaccination, including those administered long before presentation of arthritis, such as 19 months in the present patient. Early diagnosis and correct treatment are crucial for successful treatment.”

Occurrence of severe destructive lyme arthritis in hamsters vaccinated with outer surface protein A and challenged with Borrelia burgdorferi.
“When the canine rOspA vaccine was combined with aluminum hydroxide, all vaccinated hamsters developed arthritis after challenge with B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. Histopathologic examination confirmed the development of severe destructive arthritis in rOspA-vaccinated hamsters challenged with B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. These findings suggest that rOspA vaccines should be modified to eliminate epitopes of OspA responsible for the induction of arthritis. Our results are important because an rOspA vaccine in aluminum hydroxide was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in humans.”

Reactive arthritis after influenza vaccination: report of a case.
“We describe a patient with reactive arthritis (ReA) induced by influenza vaccination. A healthy 79-year-old Japanese man began suffering from migrating polyarthritis 2 days after receiving influenza vaccine. He proved negative for rheumatoid factor, showing no evidence for microbial infections such as Streptoccocci, Chlamydia, or Parbovirus B19. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing analysis revealed positive results for HLA-B54 (22), which is one of the cross-reactive antigens to HLA-B27. His arthritis improved with administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and recovery was attained within 6 weeks. Reactive arthritis is a rare adverse effect induced by influenza vaccination; however, it is important that it is recognized by all physicians.”

Vaccinations and risk of systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
(2017)
“The pooled findings suggested that vaccinations significantly increased risk of SLE (RR=1.50; 95%CI 1.05-2.12, P=0.02). In addition, there was an obvious association between vaccinations and increased risk of RA (RR=1.32; 95%CI 1.09-1.60, P=0.004). Meta-analysis of studies reporting outcomes of short vaccinated time also suggested that vaccinations could significantly increase risk of SLE (RR=1.93; 95%CI 1.07-3.48, P=0.028) and RA (RR=1.48; 95%CI 1.08-2.03, P=0.015).”

Autoimmune/auto-inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA) after quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccination in Colombians: a call for personalised medicine.
“This was a case study in which 3 patients with autoimmune/auto-inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA) after quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccination (HPV) were evaluated and described. All the patients were women. Diagnosis consisted of HLA-B27 enthesitis related arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematous, respectively. Our results highlight the risk of developing ASIA after HPV vaccination and may serve to increase the awareness of such a complication. Factors that are predictive of developing autoimmune diseases should be examined at the population level in order to establish preventive measures in at-risk individuals for whom healthcare should be personalized and participatory.”

Involvement of chronic epipharyngitis in autoimmune (auto-inflammatory) syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA). 2017 
“The epipharynx is an immunologically active site even under normal conditions, and enhanced immunologic activation is prone to occur in response to an upper respiratory infection, air pollution, and possibly to vaccine adjuvants. Due to the potential link between the central nervous system and immune function, a relationship between epipharyngitis and autonomic nervous disturbance as well as autoimmune disease has been suggested. Various functional somatic symptoms have been described after human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination, although a causal relationship has not been established. We examined the epipharynx in young women showing functional somatic symptoms following HPV vaccination. Surprisingly, despite having minimal symptoms involving the pharynx, all patients were found to have severe epipharyngitis. In addition, significant improvement in symptoms was seen in most patients who underwent epipharyngeal treatment. Thus, we speculate that the chronic epipharyngitis potentially caused by the vaccine adjuvant may be involved in the pathogenesis of functional somatic syndrome (FSS) post-HPV vaccination. Further, we suggest that epipharyngeal treatment may be effective for various types of FSS regardless of the initial cause, as well as for some autoimmune diseases, and that this may be an important direction in future research.”

Severe manifestations of autoimmune syndrome induced by adjuvants (Shoenfeld’s syndrome).
“From 2011 to 2016, we identified 4479 ASIA cases, of them 305 fulfilled arbitrary criteria of severe ASIA including our case presentation and 11 deaths. The majority of severe ASIA cases were related to HPV vaccine, silicone, influenza vaccine and mineral oil injections. The interval from exposition to severe manifestation was from 2 days to 23 years. (1) This is the first study that analyzes all cases published on ASIA with severe manifestations. (2) The current HPV vaccine is both effective and generally safe. However, it should be noted that severe autoimmune side effects have been reported in several studies. Severe ASIA may be observed after influenza vaccines, and other vaccines. (3) Efforts should be made to discover the connection between adjuvants, autoimmunity and autoimmune diseases, because there is an increase in cases severe and life-threatening of ASIA.”

“Cadmium, arsenic, lead, and mercury have been linked to autism, attention deficit disorder, mental retardation and death of children. Mercury in thimerosal found in many vaccines and flu shots contributes significantly to these problems. Decomposition of the thimerosal can produce more toxic compounds, either methylethylmercury or diethylmercury, in the body. These compounds have a toxicity level similar to dimethylmercury. Within the human body, a mitochondrial disorder may release the more toxic form of mercury internally. Young children and pregnant women must minimize internal exposure to the vaccines and flu shots containing mercury.”

Acetaminophen (paracetamol) use, measles-mumps-rubella vaccination, and autistic disorder: the results of a parent survey.
“The present study was performed to determine whether acetaminophen (paracetamol) use after the measles-mumps-rubella vaccination could be associated with autistic disorder. This case-control study used the results of an online parental survey conducted from 16 July 2021 to 30 January 2006, consisting of 83 children with autistic disorder and 80 control children. Acetaminophen use after measles-mumps-rubella vaccination was significantly associated with autistic disorder when considering children 5 years of age or less (OR 6.11, 95% CI 1.42-26.3), after limiting cases to children with regression in development (OR 3.97, 95% CI 1.11-14.3), and when considering only children who had post-vaccination sequelae (OR 8.23, 95% CI 1.56-43.3), adjusting for age, gender, motherâs ethnicity, and the presence of illness concurrent with measles-mumps-rubella vaccination. Ibuprofen use after measles-mumps-rubella vaccination was not associated with autistic disorder. This preliminary study found that acetaminophen use after measles-mumps-rubella vaccination was associated with autistic disorder.”

Conjugate vaccines and autism.
“In this issue of the Journal, Brian J. Richmand presents a novel hypothesis to relate an apparent increase in autism and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) to the introduction of conjugate vaccines to bacterial capsular carbohydrates. The proposal is based on parallel lines of evidence, epidemiologic and biologic.”

(Lyme disease and autism)
(Incorrect testing methods for Lyme disease and other tick-borne illnesses are currently being used. Vaccines trigger latent infections, which are commonly passed on in utero.) 
ð Divergent opinions of proper Lyme disease diagnosis and implications for children co-morbid with autism spectrum disorder.
“This paper proposes that some children with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the United States have undiagnosed Lyme disease and different testing criteria used by commercial laboratories may be producing false negative results. Two testing protocols will be evaluated; first, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) approved two-tiered Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) or Immunofluorescence Assay (IFA) followed by an IgM and/or IgG Western Blot test. Second, a clinical diagnosis (flu like symptoms, joint pain, fatigue, neurological symptoms, etc.) possibly followed by a Western Blot with a broader criteria for positive bands [1]. The hypothesis proposes that the former criteria may be producing false negative results for some individuals diagnosed with an ASD. Through an online survey parents of 48 children who have a diagnosis of an ASD and have been diagnosed with Lyme disease were asked to fill out the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC) before they started antibiotic therapy and after treatment. Of the 48 parents surveyed 45 of them (94%) indicated their child initially tested negative using the two-tiered CDC/IDSA approved test. The parents sought a second physician who diagnosed their child with Lyme disease using the wider range of Western Blot bands. The children were treated with antibiotics and their scores on the ATEC improved. Anecdotal data indicated that some of the children achieved previously unattained developmental milestones after antibiotic therapy began. Protein bands OSP-A and/or OSP-B (Western Blot band 31) and (Western Blot band 34) were found in 44 of 48 patients. These two bands are so specific to Borrelia burgdorferi that they were targeted for use in vaccine trials, yet are not included in the IDSA interpretation of the Western Blot.”

ð A possible central mechanism in autism spectrum disorders, part 1.
“The autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of related neurodevelopmental disorders that have been increasing in incidence since the 1980s. Despite a considerable amount of data being collected from cases, a central mechanism has not been offered. A careful review of ASD cases discloses a number of events that adhere to an immunoexcitotoxic mechanism. This mechanism explains the link between excessive vaccination, use of aluminum and ethylmercury as vaccine adjuvants, food allergies, gut dysbiosis, and abnormal formation of the developing brain. It has now been shown that chronic microglial activation is present in autistic brains from age 5 years to age 44 years. A considerable amount of evidence, both experimental and clinical, indicates that repeated microglial activation can initiate priming of the microglia and that subsequent stimulation can produce an exaggerated microglial response that can be prolonged. It is also known that one phenotypic form of microglia activation can result in an outpouring of neurotoxic levels of the excitotoxins, glutamate and quinolinic acid. Studies have shown that careful control of brain glutamate levels is essential to brain pathway development and that excesses can result in arrest of neural migration, as well as dendritic and synaptic loss. It has also been shown that certain cytokines, such as TNF-alpha, can, via its receptor, interact with glutamate receptors to enhance the neurotoxic reaction. To describe this interaction I have coined the term immunoexcitotoxicity, which is described in this article.”

The potential importance of steroids in the treatment of autistic spectrum disorders and other disorders involving mercury toxicity.
“Recently emerging evidence suggests that mercury, especially from childhood vaccines, appears to be a factor in the development of the autistic disorders, and that autistic children have higher than normal body-burdens of mercury. In considering mercury toxicity, it has previously been shown that testosterone significantly potentates mercury toxicity, whereas estrogen is protective.”

Rubella and congenital rubella (German measles).
“Issues of risk, choice, and chance are central to the controversy over the MMR vaccine that erupted in the UK in 1998, and has continued into the new millennium. An important contribution to the MMR controversy has come from the parents of autistic children, some of whom reject the notion that this disorder is a random genetic misfortune and insist that it is, at least in part, the result of some environmental insult, such as MMR vaccinations.”

Autoimmune/auto-inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA) after quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccination in Colombians: a call for personalised medicine.
“This was a case study in which 3 patients with autoimmune/auto-inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA) after quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccination (HPV) were evaluated and described. All the patients were women. Diagnosis consisted of HLA-B27 enthesitis related arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematous, respectively. Our results highlight the risk of developing ASIA after HPV vaccination and may serve to increase the awareness of such a complication. Factors that are predictive of developing autoimmune diseases should be examined at the population level in order to establish preventive measures in at-risk individuals for whom healthcare should be personalized and participatory.”

CONCLUSION: Influenza vaccine is one of the most commonly used vaccines worldwide, with millions of people being vaccinated annually. Despite its wide use, only sparse information has been published concerning any hematological effects of this vaccine. The rarity of such effects supports the safety of using this vaccine.”

A case of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) following Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination.
“A 15-year-old young woman received the Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines. Following the second HPV vaccination, intermittent fever, myalgia, arthritis and malar rash developed, and she was admitted to our hospital. Laboratory studies showed positive results for antinuclear antibody, anti-dsDNA antibody and anti-Sm antibody. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was diagnosed according to the Systemic Lupus International Collaborative Clinics 2012. Magnetic resonance imaging showed abnormal hyperintense areas in the fascia, and en bloc biopsy showed fasciitis. Treatment with prednisolone resulted in an amelioration of the symptoms. Reportedly, SLE developed after HPV vaccinations in some patients. Most such patients have a past or family history of autoimmune disease and presented SLE symptoms after the second vaccination. We describe herein a patient in whom SLE developed in association with HPV vaccination.”

ð Demyelinating disease and polyvalent human papilloma virus vaccination
“Since its inception, the polyvalent vaccine against the human papilloma virus (HPV), Gardasil, has generated some controversies as a temporal relationship between the administrations of the vaccine and the development of a few autoimmune diseases, such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), multiple sclerosis (MS) and GuillainâBarre syndrome have been reported.1â3 We encountered two cases whose initial presentation of CNS demyelination followed in close time relationship the administration of Gardasil vaccine and we discuss their possible association.
Case No 1
A 19-year-old woman received two doses of Gardasil, 3 months apart, and approximately 1 month after the second dose, she developed numbness to the right foot that within 1 day extended to the contralateral foot and was associated with mid-thoracic back pain. Her neurological examination was only significant for the altered perception to touch to the feet. Deep tendon reflexes were normal and plantar reflexes in flexion. MRI of cervical and thoracic spine revealed a total of three lesions with characteristic demyelinating appearance, one of those in the thoracic spine was contrast-enhancing (figure 1AâC). MRI brain demonstrated one additional white matter lesion also consistent with a demyelinating process.”

[Demyelinating disease and vaccination of the human papillomavirus].
“CASE REPORTS: We describe the cases of four young women that developed demyelinating disease after the vaccination of the HPV, with a rank of time between the administration of the dose and the development of the clinical of seven days to a month, with similar symptoms with the successive doses. We have described six episodes coinciding after the vaccination.
CONCLUSIONS: Have been described seizures, autoimmune disorders such as Guillain-Barre syndrome, transverse myelitis, or motor neuron disease, probably adverse effects following immunization by HPV vaccine. So we suggest that vaccine may trigger an immunological mechanism leading to demyelinating events, perhaps in predisposed young.”

Involvement of chronic epipharyngitis in autoimmune (auto-inflammatory) syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA). 2017 
“The epipharynx is an immunologically active site even under normal conditions, and enhanced immunologic activation is prone to occur in response to an upper respiratory infection, air pollution, and possibly to vaccine adjuvants. Due to the potential link between the central nervous system and immune function, a relationship between epipharyngitis and autonomic nervous disturbance as well as autoimmune disease has been suggested. Various functional somatic symptoms have been described after human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination, although a causal relationship has not been established. We examined the epipharynx in young women showing functional somatic symptoms following HPV vaccination. Surprisingly, despite having minimal symptoms involving the pharynx, all patients were found to have severe epipharyngitis. In addition, significant improvement in symptoms was seen in most patients who underwent epipharyngeal treatment. Thus, we speculate that the chronic epipharyngitis potentially caused by the vaccine adjuvant may be involved in the pathogenesis of functional somatic syndrome (FSS) post-HPV vaccination. Further, we suggest that epipharyngeal treatment may be effective for various types of FSS regardless of the initial cause, as well as for some autoimmune diseases, and that this may be an important direction in future research.”

Multiple sclerosis and hepatitis B vaccination: could minute contamination of the vaccine by partial hepatitis B virus polymerase play a role through molecular mimicry?
“Reports of multiple sclerosis developing after hepatitis B vaccination have led to the concern that this vaccine might be a cause of multiple sclerosis in previously healthy subjects. Some articles evidenced that minor Hepatitis B virus (HBV) polymerase proteins could be produced by alternative transcriptional or translational strategies. Their detection is very difficult because they are in minute concentration and probably enzymatically inactive, however, it was shown that they could be exposed on the outside of the virus particles and also be immunogenic. In addition, HBV polymerase shares significant amino acid similarities with the human myelin basic protein. We hypothesise that some of the apparent adverse reactions to the vaccine could be due to a process called of molecular mimicry, the HBV polymerase, which could be a contaminant in the recombinant or plasma-derived vaccines, could act as autoantigens and induce autoimmune demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis.”

Occurrence of severe destructive lyme arthritis in hamsters vaccinated with outer surface protein A and challenged with Borrelia burgdorferi.
“When the canine rOspA vaccine was combined with aluminum hydroxide, all vaccinated hamsters developed arthritis after challenge with B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. Histopathologic examination confirmed the development of severe destructive arthritis in rOspA-vaccinated hamsters challenged with B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. These findings suggest that rOspA vaccines should be modified to eliminate epitopes of OspA responsible for the induction of arthritis. Our results are important because an rOspA vaccine in aluminum hydroxide was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in humans.”

Severe manifestations of autoimmune syndrome induced by adjuvants (Shoenfeldâs syndrome).
“From 2011 to 2016, we identified 4479 ASIA cases, of them 305 fulfilled arbitrary criteria of severe ASIA including our case presentation and 11 deaths. The majority of severe ASIA cases were related to HPV vaccine, silicone, influenza vaccine and mineral oil injections. The interval from exposition to severe manifestation was from 2 days to 23 years. (1) This is the first study that analyzes all cases published on ASIA with severe manifestations. (2) The current HPV vaccine is both effective and generally safe. However, it should be noted that severe autoimmune side effects have been reported in several studies. Severe ASIA may be observed after influenza vaccines, and other vaccines. (3) Efforts should be made to discover the connection between adjuvants, autoimmunity and autoimmune diseases, because there is an increase in cases severe and life-threatening of ASIA.”

Status epilepticus and lymphocytic pneumonitis following hepatitis B vaccination.
“The case reported refers to a patient who developed status epilepticus in the day of her third dose of hepatitis B vaccination and we review the literature on this subject. A 12 year-old girl, without a relevant previous history, taking no drugs, developed a seizure attack followed by unconsciousness, and eventually died after three days of her third dose of hepatitis B (HB) vaccination. Autopsy study revealed cerebral edema with congestion and herniation and diffuse interstitial type pneumonitis. There seem to be a straight forward time relationship between the third HB vaccine, the event of convulsion and the sudden death of the patient. We suggest that, in some cases, vaccination may be the triggering factor for autoimmune and neurological disturbances in genetically predisposed individuals and physicians should be aware of this possible association.”

ð An unmasking phenomenon in an observational post-licensure safety study of adolescent girls and young women.
“Our recent experience in a post-licensure safety study of autoimmune conditions following the quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine in 189,629 girls and young women ages 9-26 years led us to question the adequacy of the exclusion of Day 0 events to prevent the erroneous association of prevalent conditions with vaccination. Of the 18 confirmed cases of Gravesâ disease diagnosed in days 1-60 following vaccination, only 6 cases appeared to be truly new onset. Among the remaining 12 cases, 2 cases had abnormal thyroid stimulating hormone or thyroxine labs drawn prior to or on Day 0 but had no documented pre-existing symptoms. The other 10 cases had mention of symptoms of hyperthyroidism referencing a period prior to first HPV-4 dose. This ‘unmaskingâ phenomenon, due to health care visits that include vaccination and new workups of preexisting symptoms, may not be adequately controlled through the exclusion of Day 0 events.”

Vaccinations and secondary immune thrombocytopenia with antiphospholipid antibodies by human papillomavirus vaccine.
“A 13-year-old girl developed immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and concomitant positive antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) following vaccination with a quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. During the course of a disease, she developed clinical manifestation with bleeding and she was treated with intravenous immunoglobulins. Consequently, the number of her platelets remained critically low and she was put on corticosteroids and rituximab. Since then, her platelet count remain within the normal range, but her aPL are still present.

                                The Adverse Events, Signs, and Management of Neonatal Bacillus Calmette-Guérin Vaccine Overdose.
“A two-day-old male neonate was inadvertently immunized with 20-times the recommended dose of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine (1.0 ml instead of 0.05 ml).”

Adverse reactions to BCG.
“In the post-war period the following BCG vaccines were successively in use for preventive vaccination in the Czech territory: (a) Copenhagen BCG, 1947-1950, (b) Prague BCG 725, 1951-1980, (c) Moscow BCG, 1981-1993, and (d) Behring BCG, from 1994 onwards. These BCG substrains can be now identified by modern methods of molecular genetics. Introducing the Moscow BCG brought about an elevated incidence of iatrogenic local and regional lymph node adverse reactions compared with the previous Prague BCG product and, as a new phenomenon, bone and joint involvements in children vaccinated at birth. The aim of this study was to analyze the incidence of postvaccination adverse reactions reported in the period from 1981 to 1993 as related to the Moscow BCG vaccine and, to demonstrate the effect of lower vaccination dosage on their frequency. The concentration of the Moscow BCG varied from 11 to 22.6 x 10(6) (average 16.2) CFU per 1 mg. In the period when full dose of BCG (0.05 mg per 0.1 ml) was applied to newborns 437 local and 195 regional lymph node complications were recorded, i.e. 0.08% of vaccinated were affected, demanding antituberculosis chemotherapy in 6.5% and surgical interventions in 24%. When the lowered vaccination dose (0.025 mg per 0.1 ml) was inoculated to newborns the local adverse reactions rose paradoxically affecting 0.1% of vaccinated but the regional lymph node reactions fell considerably to reach 0.01%; the demand for chemotherapy and surgery also fell down to 3.1 and 4.8% respectively. Bone and joint adverse involvements were recorded in 28 cases, i.e. in 3.7 per 10(5) of those vaccinated with the full dose.”

Bacillus Calmette-Guérin reactivation as a sign of incomplete Kawasaki disease.
“An early and specific clinical sign, not included in the classical diagnosis criteria, but that can be very useful in the diagnosis of KD, is the reaction at the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) inoculation site. We describe a case of a 4-month-old boy, fully immunised, whose BCG scar reactivation led to the diagnosis of IKD. This case-report emphasises the importance of BCG site reactivation in establishing a diagnosis of IKD that clinicians should be aware of, especially in countries where BCG vaccination is still part of the immunisation schedule.

Borderline tuberculoid leprosy following BCG vaccination. A case report.
“Borderline tuberculoid leprosy was diagnosed clinically and histologically in a four year-old boy about 6 months after intradermal vaccination with BCG. His mother reported that a lesion began to appear above the vaccination site on the arm 2 weeks after the vaccination, and a second lesion appeared on the chin 2 months later. Responses in the lymphocyte transformation test to sonicated Mycobacterium leprae, BCG, and to PPD were consistent with a tuberculoid leprosy infection. Precipitation of BT leprosy by intradermal BCG infection may possibly represent the overcoming of a phase of primary suppression in an individual who might otherwise have progressed toward lepromatous leprosy. The implications of this hypothesis for the planning of a controlled trial of an anti-leprosy vaccine are discussed.”

[“Euthanasia”-victims and test subjects. The fate of diseased, disabled children in Berlin during World War II].
“This article shows, through a study of the Berlin-Brandenburg region, that children and juveniles who were subjected to the killings of diseased and disabled, or mentally retarded, persons during the Third Reich did not only fall victim to the operations of the “Reichsausschuss” (“Reich Commission for Registration of Severe Disorders in Childhood”). Many were also included in the gas chamber killings of the “T4”-action and in various decentralized killing actions. Furthermore, the co-operation of various medical disciplines in the misuse of children for scientific research is demonstrated by looking into the research on a tuberculosis vaccine. It can be shown that the purpose of the killings was not the painless ending of individual suffering, but that they constituted a means of freeing the public from so-called “ballast existences”, whose lives were only prolonged if they could be of scientific use.”

Mycobacterial Arthritis at 19 Months After a Bacille Calmette-Guérin Vaccination. (2017)
“A 20-month-old afebrile boy living in northern Taiwan presented with swelling of the right knee for 5 days. No other respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms were associated. A bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccination had been performed when he was 1 month of age. The X-ray showed no bony destruction, and the sonography revealed some fluid accumulation in the right suprapatellar pouch. Arthrocentesis was performed, and characteristically cream-colored pus was drained (Figure 1 ). The knee swelling persisted, and magnetic resonance imaging showed abscess formation in the right suprapatellar bursa (Figures 2 and ​and33 ). Furthermore, surgical debridement was performed, and histological examination revealed granulomatous inflammation with caseation necrosis. The pus culture yielded Mycobacterium bovis. The patient was immunocompetent and was administered with isoniazid and rifampicin. He recovered without complications.
Tuberculosis remains an important health threat and the live attenuated BCG vaccine was used to prevent childhood tuberculosis. In 2009, the annual incidence of tuberculosis in Taiwan was approximately 69 cases/100,000 persons, and the Tokyo-172 BCG vaccination was included in the national immunization program with a coverage rate of 97%.1,2 BCG-related arthritis and osteitis is a rare but severe complication.3 The lower extremities are most commonly involved.4 The estimated incidence rates of BCG-related osteitis/osteomyelitis vary with place, time, and vaccine strain; for example, two cases per million vaccinations in Japan and 30 cases per million vaccinations in Finland.4,5 In Taiwan, the incidence was 12.9 cases per million vaccinations during 2005–2007.2 Pediatricians should remain alert for mycobacterial infections in children with BCG vaccination, including those administered long before presentation of arthritis, such as 19 months in the present patient. Early diagnosis and correct treatment are crucial for successful treatment.”

Mycobacterium bovis lymphadenitis complicating BCG immunization in an infant with symptomatic HIV-1 infection.
“A 3-month-old infant with HIV-1 infection who recently immigrated from Ethiopia developed regional lymphadenitis and systemic symptoms subsequent to BCG immunization. She was suffering from axillary lymphadenitis ipsilateral to the BCG vaccination site, failure to thrive, unresolving fever and hepatosplenomegaly. Acid-fast bacilli were seen on staining and Mycobacterium bovis was isolated from the regional lymph node. The infant responded promptly to triple antituberculous therapy but died 2 months later from overwhelming pneumonia and respiratory failure. This case emphasizes the iatrogenic hazards of BCG immunization in HIV-1 infected infants. With the increasing prevalence of pediatric HIV-1 infection, indiscriminate BCG immunization programs should be reconsidered. While infants with asymptomatic HIV-1 infection at risk for tuberculosis should be immunized, BCG immunization should be withheld in those with symptomatic disease.”

Routine BCG vaccination in Mexico leads to a 99% coverage in infants younger than 1 year. We present a case of Kawasaki disease with skin lesions at the site of BCG. Clinicians should be aware of this clinical manifestation that could help diagnose atypical or incomplete cases of the disease.”

[“…. sustaining their lives has no advantage to the nation.” Handicapped children as research subjects and the development of preventive tuberculosis vaccination].
“A large number of disabled or mentally retarded children were killed in the so-called “Children’s Special Departments” of the “Third Reich”. Such children were also misused in scientific research. Ambitious physicians in the “Children’s Special Departments” experimented on them in co-operation with other institutions. This happened, for example, in research on the tuberculosis vaccine. The effectiveness of the BCG-vaccine was primarily tested at the Children’s University Hospital of Vienna. Disabled children were first given the BCG-vaccine and then deliberately contaminated with tuberculosis bacteria. Subsequently they were transferred to Vienna’s “Children’s Special Department” in order to be killed there. The efficacy of vaccination was supposed to be demonstrable in their autopsies. Vaccine experiments were also carried out in the “Children’s Special Departments” of Berlin and Kaufbeuren. There were likewise co-operations with other institutions.”

Two infants with tuberculid associated with Kawasaki disease.
“The adverse events of BCG vaccination, including local reactions, lymphadenitis, osteomyelitis, tuberculid, and disseminated infection, have been reported. Two infants presented erythema at the inoculation site of BCG after the resolution of Kawasaki disease (KD). They received BCG vaccination 1 week and 6 weeks before the KD onset, respectively. Intravenous immunoglobulin improved the KD activity, however the skin rash of BCG inoculation site extended to the face and extremities days 24 and 10 after the KD onset, respectively. Both bacteriological study and interferon-γ release assay were negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. These patients were diagnosed as having tuberculid after KD.”

An ulcerated lesion at the BCG vaccination site during the course of Kawasaki disease.
“We describe a bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) granuloma that occurred during the course of Kawasaki disease. A 12-month-old male infant with Kawasaki disease had an erythematous indurated plaque with prominent necrotic ulceration at the BCG vaccination site on the left upper arm. Histologic study showed a granulomatous reaction consisting of epithelioid histiocytes, lymphoid cells, and Langhans-type giant cells. No evidence of mycobacterial infection was obtained. The lesion healed completely within 2 weeks without administration of antituberculous agents. We believe that the granulomatous reaction occurred as a result of hypersensitivity to proteins in the BCG vaccine, which appeared after the onset of Kawasaki disease.”

Effect of immunization against rubella on lactation products. II. Maternal-neonatal interactions.
” Infectious rubella virus or virus antigen was observed in the breast milk of 11 (68%) of the 16 vaccinated, breast-feeding women studied. After maternal immunization, infectious rubella virus or virus antigen was recovered from the nasopharynx and throat of 56% of the breast-fed infants and from none of the non-breast-fed infants.”

Postpartum live virus vaccination: lessons from veterinary medicine.
“Pregnant rubella-susceptible women are often revaccinated during the postpartum period with the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella vaccine (MMR). It is known that the rubella virus from vaccine is secreted in breast milk and persists in the nose and throat for up to 28 days but it is not known whether the measles and mumps viruses are similarly secreted. It is probable the measles virus from vaccine is.”

Postpartum rubella immunization: association with development of prolonged arthritis, neurological sequelae, and chronic rubella viremia.
“Six women developed chronic long-term arthropathy after postpartum immunization against rubella. All individuals developed acute polyarticular arthritis within 12 days to three weeks postimmunization and have had continuing chronic or recurrent arthralgia or arthritis for two to seven years after vaccination. Acute neurological manifestations, consisting of carpal tunnel syndrome or multiple paresthesiae, developed postvaccination in three women. Two have developed continuing active or chronic recurrent episodes of blurred vision, paresthesiae, and painful limb syndromes together with recurrent joint symptoms. Chronic rubella viremia has been detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (MNC) populations in five of the six women up to six years after vaccination. In addition rubella virus was isolated from breast milk MNCs in one individual at nine months postvaccination and from peripheral blood MNCs in two of four breast-fed infants studied at 12-18 months of age. Immune responses to rubella virus studied at sequential intervals after vaccination correlated with development of rheumatologic and neurological manifestations.”

Secondary and Tertiary Transfer of Vaccinia Virus Among U.S. Military Personnel — United States and Worldwide, 2002-2004
“Case 1. In early May 2003, a service member received his primary smallpox vaccination. Approximately 6-8 days after vaccination, he experienced a major reaction (i.e., an event that indicates a successful take; is characterized by a papule, vesicle, ulcer, or crusted lesion, surrounded by an area of induration; and usually results in a scar) (4). The vaccinee reported no substantial pruritus. He slept in the same bed as his wife and kept the vaccination site covered with bandages. After bathing, he reportedly dried the vaccination site with tissue, which he discarded into a trash receptacle. He also used separate towels to dry himself, rolled them so the area that dried his arm was inside, and placed them in a laundry container. His wife handled bed linen, soiled clothing, and towels; she reported that she did not see any obvious drainage on clothing or linen and had no direct contact with the vaccination site.
In mid-May, the wife had vesicular skin lesions on each breast near the areola but continued to breastfeed. Approximately 2 weeks later, she was examined at a local hospital, treated for mastitis, and continued to breastfeed. The same day, the infant had a vesicular lesion on the upper lip, followed by another lesion on the left cheek (5). Three days later, the infant was examined by a pediatrician, when another lesion was noted on her tongue. Because of possible early atopic dermatitis lesions on the infantâs cheeks, contact vaccinia infection with increased risk for eczema vaccinatum was considered. The infant was transferred to a military referral medical center for further evaluation. On examination, the infant had seborrheic dermatitis and no ocular involvement. Skin lesion specimens from the mother and infant tested positive for vaccinia by viral culture and PCR at the Alaska Health Department Laboratory and at Madigan Army Medical Center. Because both patients were stable clinically and the lesions were healing without risk for more serious complications, vaccinia immune globulin was not administered. Neither patient had systemic complications from the infection.
Case 2. In July 2003, a service member who had been vaccinated was wrestling with an unvaccinated service member at a military recreational function when the bandages covering the vaccination site fell off. The unvaccinated service member subsequently wrestled with another unvaccinated service member. Six days later, both unvaccinated service members had lesions on their forearms, neck, and face. Skin lesion specimens from both men tested positive for vaccinia virus by PCR and viral culture at Tripler Army Medical Centerâs microbiology laboratory.”

Tertiary contact vaccinia in a breastfeeding infant. 2004. 
“The vaccinee reported observing all of the standard precautions to avoid household spread. In mid May, his breastfeeding wife developed vesicles on both areolas. On May 29, their infant daughter developed a papule on her philtrum. Contact vaccinia was confirmed by positive polymerase chain reaction and culture for vaccinia of both the maternal and infant lesions. This is the first documented case of inadvertent contact vaccinia transmission from a mother to her infant through direct skin-to-skin and skin-to-mucous membrane contact while breastfeeding. The mechanism of transfer from the vaccinee to the spouse is uncertain. This report demonstrates that breastfeeding infants living in close contact with smallpox vaccinees are at potential risk for contact vaccinia, even if the vaccinee is not the breastfeeding mother, and highlights the need for special precautions to prevent secondary transfer to breastfeeding mothers.”

Transmission of yellow fever vaccine virus through breast-feeding - Brazil, 2009.
“The infant, who was exclusively breast-fed, was hospitalized at age 23 days with seizures requiring continuous infusion of intravenous anticonvulsants. The infant received antimicrobial and antiviral treatment for meningoencephalitis. The presence of 17DD yellow fever virus was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the infantâs cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); yellow fever-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies also were present in serum and CSF.”

ð Association between SV40 and non-Hodgkinâs lymphoma.
“Millions of people worldwide were inadvertently exposed to live simian virus 40 (SV40) between 1955 and 1963 through immunization with SV40-contaminated polio vaccines. Although the prevalence of SV40 infections in humans is not known, numerous studies suggest that SV40 is a pathogen resident in the human population today. SV40 is a potent DNA tumor virus that is known to induce primary brain cancers, bone cancers, mesotheliomas, and lymphomas in laboratory animals.”

ð Childhood cancer, intramuscular vitamin K, and pethidine given during labour.
“…but there was a significant association (p = 0.002) with intramuscular vitamin K (odds ratio 1.97, 95% confidence interval 1.3 to 3.0) when compared with oral vitamin K or no vitamin K. There was no significantly increased risk for children who had been given oral vitamin K when compared with no vitamin K (odds ratio 1.15, 95% confidence interval 0.5 to 2.7). These results could not be accounted for by other factors associated with administration of intramuscular vitamin K, such as type of delivery or admission to a special care baby unit.”
“The only two studies so far to have examined the relation between childhood cancer and intramuscular vitamin K have shown similar results, and the relation is biologically plausible. The prophylactic benefits against haemorrhagic disease are unlikely to exceed the potential adverse effects from intramuscular vitamin K. Since oral vitamin K has major benefits but no obvious adverse effects this could be the prophylaxis of choice.”

Endogenous retroviruses as potential hazards for vaccines.
“Retroviruses are classified as exogenous or endogenous according to their mode of transmission. Generally, endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are not pathogenic in their original hosts; however, some ERVs induce diseases. In humans, a novel gammaretrovirus was discovered in patients with prostate cancer or chronic fatigue syndrome. This virus was closely related to xenotropic murine leukemia virus (X-MLV) and designated as xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV). The origin and transmission route of XMRV are still unknown at present; however, XMRV may be derived from ERVs of rodents because X-MLVs are ERVs of inbred and wild mice. Many live attenuated vaccines for animals are manufactured by using cell lines from animals, which are known to produce infectious ERVs; however, the risks of infection by ERVs from xenospecies through vaccination have been ignored. This brief review gives an overview of ERVs in cats, the potential risks of ERV infection by vaccination, the biological characteristics of RD-114 virus (a feline ERV), which possibly contaminates vaccines for companion animals, and the methods for detection of infectious RD-114 virus.

Epidemiological characteristics of childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia. Analysis by immunophenotype. The Childrens Cancer Group.
“Factors with elevated and/or significant ORs included: (i) for common ALL (n = 286): Down syndrome; family history (FH) of bone/joint diseases; postnatal jaundice; birthweight; MMR vaccination;…” 
“While a number of epidemiological studies of childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) have been conducted, separate analysis of risk factors for ALL subtypes has generally not been possible. We report the results of an analysis of data obtained from parents of children with ALL (and a control group of children without cancer), linked to a clinical database. Cases were classified into four ALL subtypes, and odds ratios (OR) were determined for each subtype for a broad range of factors. Numerous significant associations were found, some across all subtypes and others that were subtype-specific. Factors with elevated and/or significant ORs included: (i) for common ALL (n = 286): Down syndrome; family history (FH) of bone/joint diseases; postnatal jaundice; birthweight; MMR vaccination; exposure to gases and insecticides; and parental occupational exposure to insecticides. (ii) for pre-B ALL (n = 38): FH of gastrointestinal, hematological or bone/joint diseases, or allergy; cat ownership; exposure to solvents, fumes, petroleum products, cleaning agents and farm animals; and parental exposure to farm animals, fumes and solvents; (iii) for T-cell ALL (n = 158): FH of gastrointestinal disorders, maternal age, male gender, and parental occupational exposure to metals; (iv) for null-cell ALL (n = 65): FH of congenital heart disorders; measles; and parental occupational exposure to fumes, metals or solvents. This analysis should be considered as a hypothesis-generating process for future case-control interview studies.”

Heterogeneity of the tumorigenic phenotype expressed by Madin-Darby canine kidney cells.
“The results revealed lot-to-lot variations in the tumorigenicity of MDCK cells, which were reflected by their tumor-inducing efficiency (threshold cell dose represented by mean tumor-producing dose; log(10) 50% endpoints of 5.2 for vial 1 and 4.4 for vial 2, and a tumor-producing dose of 5.8 for vial 3) and mean tumor latency (vial 1,6.6 wk; vial 2,2.9 wk; and vial 3,3.8 wk). These studies provide a reference for further characterization of the MDCK cell neoplastic phenotype and may be useful in delineating aspects of neoplastic development in vitro that determine tumor-forming capacity. Such data also are useful when considering MDCK cells as a reagent for vaccine manufacture.

Malignant Tumors as a Late Complication of Vaccination
“Four basal and one squamous cell carcinomas and a single instance of a malignant melanoma arising in vaccination scars have occurred in five southern California patients. Sun exposure on a previously scarred skin was the main etiological factor in the development of the basal and squamous cell tumors. Sun exposure was probably unimportant in the case of the melanoma because of the short time interval between vaccination and the development of the tumor.”

Malignant tumors in smallpox vaccination scars: a report of 24 cases.
“A study of 24 patients with proved malignant tumors originating in smallpox vaccination scars is reported. Three different tumor types were foundâmalignant melanomas, basal cell carcinomas, and squamous cell carcinomas. There was no exposure to known chemical carcinogens. In most cases a primary vaccination site was involved. The period of time between the vaccination and appearance of the malignant tumor was highly variable. Twenty-three of the patients were from various regions of the United States and one from the Republic of South Africa. Two patients presented tumors in vaccination sites bilaterally.
The possible role of vaccinia virus in the present cases is unknown and difficult to conceive. However, it is suggested that additional clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory studies should be made to determine the role, if any, of vaccinia virus in the development of malignant tumors in man.”

Of Mice and Men: On the Origin of XMRV.
“The novel human retrovirus xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) is arguably the most controversial virus of this moment. After its original discovery in prostate cancer tissue from North American patients, it was subsequently detected in individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome from the same continent. However, most other research groups, mainly from Europe, reported negative results. The positive results could possibly be attributed to contamination with mouse products in a number of cases, as XMRV is nearly identical in nucleotide sequence to endogenous retroviruses in the mouse genome. But the detection of integrated XMRV proviruses in prostate cancer tissue proves it to be a genuine virus that replicates in human cells, leaving the question: how did XMRV enter the human population? We will discuss two possible routes: either via direct virus transmission from mouse to human, as repeatedly seen for, e.g., Hantaviruses, or via the use of mouse-related products by humans, including vaccines. We hypothesize that mouse cells or human cell lines used for vaccine production could have been contaminated with a replicating variant of the XMRV precursors encoded by the mouse genome.”

ð Oral polio vaccine and human cancer: a reassessment of SV40 as a contaminant based upon legal documents.
“The confirmation of the removal by one drug manufacturer, Lederle, has been made public at an international symposium in January 1997, where its representatives stated that all of Lederleâs seeds had been tested and screened to assure that it was free from SV40 virus. However, in litigation involving the Lederle oral polio vaccine, the manufacturerâs internal documents failed to reveal such removal in all of the seeds. The absence of confirmatory testing of the seeds, as well as testimony of a Lederle manager, indicate that this claim of removal of SV40 and the testing for SV40 in all the seeds cannot be fully substantiated. These legal documents and testimony indicate that the scientific community should not be content with prior assumptions that SV40 could not have been in the oral polio vaccine.”

ð Oral versus intramuscular phytomenadione: safety and efficacy compared.
“Oral and intramuscular phytomenadione (vitamin K1) prophylaxis became an issue following the report of a potential carcinogenic effect of intramuscular but not oral phytomenadione prophylaxis. There is increasing evidence, however, that oral phytomenadione prophylaxis is less effective for the prevention of late vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB) than intramuscular prophylaxis. Following a report of an increased cancer risk after intramuscular phytomenadione, a series of papers on this issue appeared. Although an increased risk for solid tumours could almost certainly be excluded, a potential risk for acute lymphatic leukaemia in childhood could not be ruled out definitively. Almost all cases of late VKDB are preventable with intramuscular phytomenadione prophylaxis administered once at birth, whereas a single oral dose given at birth is much less effective. Repeated oral phytomenadione doses given to breast-fed infants either weekly (1 mg) or daily (25 microg) seem to be as effective as intramuscular phytomenadione prophylaxis. The efficacy of 3 oral 2mg doses with the new mixed micellar preparation (‘Konakion MMâ) remains to be established. Although a number of studies have failed to confirm a cancer risk with phytomenadione, these studies have been unable to rule out a risk definitely because absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. A meta-analysis of the available studies might provide 95% confidence intervals narrow enough to exclude even a small cancer risk with some certainty. Oral prophylaxis will probably be as safe as the intramuscular prophylaxis if given daily (25 microg) or weekly (1 mg).”

ð Polio, hepatitis B and AIDS: an integrative theory on a possible vaccine induced pandemic.
“The hypothesis that simian virus 40 (SV40) infected polio vaccines may be linked to the evolution of acquired immunodeficiency disorder (AIDS), and certain cancers, has been advanced. Most recently, investigators discussed the likelihood of gene-reshuffling following SV40 infection as a precursor to acquired immune dysfunction. Findings of recent SV40 infections in four children born after 1982 suggest infections were transmitted vertically along gene lines. Earlier observations proved activation of a retrovirus gene by a hepatitis B virus (HBV) protein. This paper proposes a new integrative theory on the origin of AIDS. It advances the possibility of genetic recombinations with oncogene activation by HBV involving simian viruses that likely infected polio vaccinated blood donors to the initial hepatitis B (HB) vaccine trials conducted on gay men in New York City and Ugandan Blacks in the early to mid-1970s. The socio-economic and even military ramifications associated with this politically challenging thesis are discussed.”

Apnea after immunization of preterm infants.
“However, 12 (12%) infants experienced a recurrence of apnea, and 11 (11%) had at least a 50% increase in the number of apneic and bradycardic episodes in the 72 hours after immunization.”

Adverse events following vaccination in premature infants.
“Apparent adverse events were noted in 17 of 45 (37.8%) babies: 9 (20%) had major events, i.e. apnoea, bradycardia or desaturations, and 8 (17.8%) had minor events, i.e. increased oxygen requirements, temperature instability, poor handling and feed intolerance. Babies with major events were significantly younger (p &lt; 0.05), had a lower postmenstrual age (p &lt; 0.05) and weighed less (p &lt; 0.05) at the time of vaccination compared with babies without major events.&quot; 
&quot;CONCLUSION: Vaccine-related cardiorespiratory events are relatively common in preterm babies. Problems were much more common if vaccine is administered at or before 70 d. These babies should therefore be monitored postvaccination.&quot;

ð [Cardiorespiratory events after first immunization in premature infants: a prospective cohort study].
“OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether all preterm infants born before 33 weeks of gestation need cardiorespiratory monitoring due to the risk of cardiorespiratory disturbances following their first vaccination at 2 months of age.”
“In this cohort of 41 premature infants whose mean gestational age was 30.8 weeks (SD: 1.9), 10 of these had a mild decrease in oxygen saturation or bradycardia; three developed a moderate cardiorespiratory event requiring tactile stimulation.”
“It is recommended that still-hospitalized premature infants receive their first immunizations under cardiorespiratory monitoring, as events were observed during a period of 0-24 hours thereafter.”

Incidence of apnoea and bradycardia in preterm infants following triple antigen immunization.
“Ninety-seven preterm infants were immunized with diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) prior to discharge from hospital. The mean gestational age at birth was 28.1 weeks (range 24-34) and the mean age at immunization was 80.6 days (range 44-257). Nineteen (20%) infants developed apnoea or bradycardia within 24 h of immunization. The infants who developed apnoea and/or bradycardia had a younger gestational age at birth than those who did not (P = 0.03), were artificially ventilated for longer (P = 0.01) and were more likely to have a diagnosis of chronic lung disease (P = 0.006). In the majority of infants these events were not clinically significant. Two infants who developed concurrent upper respiratory tract infections required additional oxygen and one of them was treated with oral theophylline. In general, it is safe practice to immunize preterm infants with DTP unless otherwise contraindicated. However, it is recommended that cardiorespiratory function is monitored after immunization in very preterm infants who had prolonged ventilatory support and/or chronic lung disease.”

Possible predictors of cardiorespiratory events after immunization in preterm neonates.
“Immunization was performed on 31 very preterm infants [28 weeksâ gestation (26.9-29), birth weight: 965 g (795-1,105)], and was associated with an increased incidence (p &lt; 0.01) of events lasting more than 10 s: bradycardia &lt;80 bpm [2.2 (1.1-7) vs. 1.8 (1-4)/12 h], desaturation [17.6 (9.4-36.4) vs. 13.9 (7.7-33.8)/12 h] and associated bradycardia-desaturation [IB+D, 4.1 (1.4-7.3) vs. 2.4 (1-4.6)/12 h], with mild changes in HRV and no change in RRV.&quot; 
&quot;The increase in CR events after the first immunization in very preterm infants was associated with: (1) sympathetic predominance in heart rate control (high LF/HF ratio), (2) abnormal oversimplification of HRV (low entropy) and (3) persistent respiratory rhythm control immaturity (high IB+D before vaccine).&quot;

Recurrence of cardiorespiratory events following repeat DTaP-based combined immunization in very low birth weight premature infants.
“We evaluated the tolerance to immunization of 64 very low birth weight preterm infants. Thirty-three of the infants experienced a cardiorespiratory event after the first vaccination, and 6 of these 33 (18%) had a recurrence after the second vaccination, including 2 infants previously discharged to home. A cardiorespiratory event associated with the first vaccination was the sole risk factor for recurrence identified.”

Vaccination of preterm infants by polyvalent vaccines: immunogenicity and safety- review of literature.
“In order to reduce the risk of adverse events after the administration of a polyvalent vaccine, it is essential to carefully consider the cardiorespiratory status of preterm infants during preimmunization examination, as well as their history of any cardiorespiratory dysfunctions. In such cases administering the first dose of the vaccine in a hospital setting is strongly advised.”

                                 Acute fulminant myocarditis after diphtheria, polio, and tetanus vaccination.
“We report an infant case of acute fulminant myocarditis which occurred after administration of a diphtheria, polio, and tetanus vaccination. Fever and dyspnea developed after the vaccination. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was used for intractable cardiogenic shock. The patient survived the extracorporeal support, but poor ventricular contractility recurred 2 months later and she died while waiting for heart transplantation.”

Acute myopericarditis after multiple vaccinations in an adolescent: case report and review of the literature.
“We report a case of postvaccination acute myopericarditis in an adolescent. The patient presented with acute chest pain, diffuse ST-segment elevation, and elevated cardiac enzyme levels. Cardiac MRI was consistent with acute myocarditis. He recovered within a few days with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory treatment and remains clinically stable, with improvement of MRI findings at the 10-week follow-up. Postvaccination cases of myopericarditis reported in the pediatric literature are also reviewed.”

Adverse events following vaccination in premature infants.
“Apparent adverse events were noted in 17 of 45 (37.8%) babies: 9 (20%) had major events, i.e. apnoea, bradycardia or desaturations, and 8 (17.8%) had minor events, i.e. increased oxygen requirements, temperature instability, poor handling and feed intolerance. Babies with major events were significantly younger (p &lt; 0.05), had a lower postmenstrual age (p &lt; 0.05) and weighed less (p &lt; 0.05) at the time of vaccination compared with babies without major events.&quot; 
&quot;CONCLUSION: Vaccine-related cardiorespiratory events are relatively common in preterm babies. Problems were much more common if vaccine is administered at or before 70 d. These babies should therefore be monitored postvaccination.&quot;

Incidence of apnoea and bradycardia in preterm infants following triple antigen immunization.
“Ninety-seven preterm infants were immunized with diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) prior to discharge from hospital. The mean gestational age at birth was 28.1 weeks (range 24-34) and the mean age at immunization was 80.6 days (range 44-257). Nineteen (20%) infants developed apnoea or bradycardia within 24 h of immunization. The infants who developed apnoea and/or bradycardia had a younger gestational age at birth than those who did not (P = 0.03), were artificially ventilated for longer (P = 0.01) and were more likely to have a diagnosis of chronic lung disease (P = 0.006). In the majority of infants these events were not clinically significant. Two infants who developed concurrent upper respiratory tract infections required additional oxygen and one of them was treated with oral theophylline. In general, it is safe practice to immunize preterm infants with DTP unless otherwise contraindicated. However, it is recommended that cardiorespiratory function is monitored after immunization in very preterm infants who had prolonged ventilatory support and/or chronic lung disease.”

Possible predictors of cardiorespiratory events after immunization in preterm neonates.
“Immunization was performed on 31 very preterm infants [28 weeks’ gestation (26.9-29), birth weight: 965 g (795-1,105)], and was associated with an increased incidence (p &lt; 0.01) of events lasting more than 10 s: bradycardia &lt;80 bpm [2.2 (1.1-7) vs. 1.8 (1-4)/12 h], desaturation [17.6 (9.4-36.4) vs. 13.9 (7.7-33.8)/12 h] and associated bradycardia-desaturation [IB+D, 4.1 (1.4-7.3) vs. 2.4 (1-4.6)/12 h], with mild changes in HRV and no change in RRV.&quot; 
&quot;The increase in CR events after the first immunization in very preterm infants was associated with: (1) sympathetic predominance in heart rate control (high LF/HF ratio), (2) abnormal oversimplification of HRV (low entropy) and (3) persistent respiratory rhythm control immaturity (high IB+D before vaccine).&quot;

Potential cross-reactivity between HPV16 L1 protein and sudden death-associated antigens.
“In exploring the primary sequence of the human papilloma virus (HPV) 16 major capsid L1 protein for peptide sharing with human proteins, we find that 34 pentamers from the viral capsid protein are shared with human proteins that, when altered, have been linked to short QT syndrome, arrhythmogenic cardiac disorders, cardiovascular diseases and sudden death. In particular, nine out of the 34 viral pentamers are present in a human protein, titin, alterations of which have been linked to cardiac failure and sudden cardiac death. The present data may help evaluate the potential crossreactivity risks in anti-tumor vaccination protocols based on HPV16 L1 protein.”

                                ð Commentary-Controversies surrounding mercury in vaccines: autism denial as impediment to universal immunisation.
(Autism and the CDC fraud)
“In 2004, the US Center for Disease Control (CDC) published a paper showing that there is no link between the age at which a child is vaccinated with MMR and the vaccinated childrenâs risk of a subsequent diagnosis of autism. One of the authors, William Thompson, has now revealed that statistically significant information was deliberately omitted from the paper. Thompson first told Dr S Hooker, a researcher on autism, about the manipulation of the data. Hooker analysed the raw data from the CDC study afresh. He confirmed that the risk of autism among African American children vaccinated before the age of 2 years was 340% that of those vaccinated later.”

[A case of Guillain-Barré syndrome following cholera vaccination (author’s transl)].
“A 45-year-old woman developed bilateral ascending flaccid paralysis after cholera vaccination, 15 days after the first and 1 day after the second injection. The clinical course resulted in nearly complete paralysis of the lower limbs, paresis of the upper limbs and partial involvement of the cranial nerves. There was only slight sensory loss. The CSF revealed no pleocytosis and a protein level of 206 mg/100 ml. Recovery began 2 weeks later and was almost complete after 2 months. Immunological investigations revealed no remarkable changes.”

Two-year study of the protective efficacy of the oral whole cell plus recombinant B subunit cholera vaccine in Peru.
“Stool samples were collected during diarrhea episodes and were cultured for V. cholerae. A total of 17,799 persons received 2 doses of vaccine or placebo, and 14,997 of these persons received the booster dose. After 2 doses (first surveillance period), V. cholerae biotype O1 was isolated from 17 vaccinees and 16 placebo recipients, demonstrating vaccine efficacy (VE) of -4%. After 3 doses (second surveillance period), V. cholerae O1 was isolated from 13 vaccinees and 32 placebo recipients, demonstrating VE of 61% (95% confidence interval ¿CI, 28%-79%). In the second surveillance period, the VE for illness requiring hospitalization was 82% (95% CI, 27%-96%).”

Current Safety Concerns with Human Papillomavirus Vaccine: A Cluster Analysis of Reports in VigiBaseÂ® (2017)
“Cluster analysis reveals additional reports of AEs following HPV vaccination that are serious in nature and describe symptoms that overlap those reported in cases from the recent safety signals (POTS, CRPS, and CFS), but which do not report explicit diagnoses. While the causal association between HPV vaccination and these AEs remains uncertain, more extensive analyses of spontaneous reports can better identify the relevant case series for thorough signal evaluation.”

Endogenous retroviruses as potential hazards for vaccines.
“Retroviruses are classified as exogenous or endogenous according to their mode of transmission. Generally, endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are not pathogenic in their original hosts; however, some ERVs induce diseases. In humans, a novel gammaretrovirus was discovered in patients with prostate cancer or chronic fatigue syndrome. This virus was closely related to xenotropic murine leukemia virus (X-MLV) and designated as xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV). The origin and transmission route of XMRV are still unknown at present; however, XMRV may be derived from ERVs of rodents because X-MLVs are ERVs of inbred and wild mice. Many live attenuated vaccines for animals are manufactured by using cell lines from animals, which are known to produce infectious ERVs; however, the risks of infection by ERVs from xenospecies through vaccination have been ignored. This brief review gives an overview of ERVs in cats, the potential risks of ERV infection by vaccination, the biological characteristics of RD-114 virus (a feline ERV), which possibly contaminates vaccines for companion animals, and the methods for detection of infectious RD-114 virus.

Fibromyalgia, infection and vaccination: two more parts in the etiological puzzle.
“As the pathogenesis of fibromyalgia continues to raise debate, multiple putative triggers have been implicated. The current review summarizes the available data linking fibromyalgia to either infection or vaccination. Multiple infectious agents have been associated with the development of either full-blown fibromyalgia (e.g. hepatits C), or with symptom complexes extensively overlapping with that syndrome (e.g. chronic Lyme disease). The cases of Lyme disease, mycoplasma, hepatits C and HIV are detailed. Despite the described associations, no evidence is available demonstrating the utility of antibiotic or anti-viral treatment in the management of fibromyalgia. Possible mechanistic links between fibromyalgia and HIV are reviewed. Associations have been described between various vaccinations and symptom complexes including fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome. The case of Gulf War syndrome, a functional multisystem entity sharing many clinical characteristics with fibromyalgia is discussed, with emphasis on the possibility of association with administration of multiple vaccinations during deployment in the Persian Gulf and the interaction with stress and trauma. Based on this example a model is proposed, wherein vaccinations function as co-triggers for the development of functional disorders including fibromyalgia, in conjunction with additional contributing factors.”

Simian cytomegalovirus-related stealth virus isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of a patient with bipolar psychosis and acute encephalopathy.
“A cytopathic ‘stealthâ virus was cultured from the cerebrospinal fluid of a patient with a bipolar psychotic disorder who developed a severe encephalopathy leading to a vegetative state. DNA sequencing of a polymerase chain reaction-amplified product from infected cultures has identified the virus as an African green monkey simian cytomegalovirus (SCMV)-related stealth virus. The virus is similar to the SCMV-related stealth virus isolated from a patient with chronic fatigue syndrome. The findings support the concepts that stealth viruses can account for a spectrum of dysfunctional brain diseases and that some of these viruses may have arisen from live polio viral vaccines.”

Absence of antibodies to HTLV-III in health workers after hepatitis B vaccination.
“A proportion of the plasma for the triply inactivated, plasma-derived hepatitis B vaccine produced in the United States is obtained from homosexual men. Because homosexual men are a high-risk group for the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), concern has emerged that the vaccine could harbor the AIDS agent.”

ð  Adverse effect versus quality control of the Fuenzalida-Palacios antirabies vaccine.
“We evaluated the components of the Fuenzalida-Palacios antirabies vaccine, which is till used in most developing countries in human immunization for treatment and prophylaxis. This vaccine is prepared from newborn mouse brains at 1% concentration. Even though the vaccine is considered to have a low myelin content, it is not fully free of myelin or of other undesirable components that might trigger adverse effects after vaccination. The most severe effect is a post-vaccination neuroparalytic accident associated with Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome. In the present study we demonstrate how the vaccines produced and distributed by different laboratories show different component patterns with different degrees of impurity and with varying protein concentrations, indicating that production processes can vary from one laboratory to another. These differences, which could be resolved using a better quality control process, may affect and impair immunization, with consequent risks and adverse effects after vaccination. We used crossed immunoelectrophoresis to evaluate and demonstrate the possibility of quality control in vaccine production, reducing the risk factors possibly involved in these immunizing products.”

The African polio vaccine-acquired immune deficiency syndrome connection.
“Seroepidemiological, clinical and molecular findings suggest that the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus human immunodeficiency virus-1 was introduced into the human species at the time (late 1950s) and in the geographic area (Zaire) in which millions of Africans were vaccinated with attenuated poliomyelitis virus strains that were produced in kidney tissue obtained from monkeys. Since monkeys not only harbor viruses that are remarkably similar to and genetically related to human immunodeficiency virus-1, but also served as tissue donors for the African polio vaccine, it is reasonable to suspect that a then non-detectable monkey virus with human-1-like properties was unknowingly co-cultured with the attenuated poliovirus virus and subsequently administered to the vaccinees. The possibility of such a polio vaccine-acquired immune deficiency syndrome connection is a reminder of the unpredictable danger of artifically crossing natural species-barriers in biomedical laboratories.”

ð  Association between SV40 and non-Hodgkinâs lymphoma.
“Millions of people worldwide were inadvertently exposed to live simian virus 40 (SV40) between 1955 and 1963 through immunization with SV40-contaminated polio vaccines. Although the prevalence of SV40 infections in humans is not known, numerous studies suggest that SV40 is a pathogen resident in the human population today. SV40 is a potent DNA tumor virus that is known to induce primary brain cancers, bone cancers, mesotheliomas, and lymphomas in laboratory animals.”

ð  Assessment of iatrogenic transmission of HCV in Southern Italy: was the cause the Salk polio vaccination?
“Since the first studies on hepatitis C virus (HCV) prevalence were published, it has been evident that southern Italy is an area of hyperendemicity. A recent study conducted in southern Italy suggested that the high prevalence of HCV infection might be the result of past iatrogenic transmission. Polio vaccination with the parenteral Salk vaccine between 1956 and 1965 by multiple use of unsafe glass syringes may have been one of the major causes of the spread of HCV infection among southern Italian adults who are now older than 40 years of age. Persons born between the 1940s and early 1960s have a nearly 3-fold increased risk of HCV seropositivity than the younger age group. The findings are consistent with a cohort effect of exposure to the Salk parenteral vaccination.”

Bridging the gap: human diploid cell strains and the origin of AIDS.
“Although the theory of a chimpanzee origin of HIV-1 with cross-species transfer to man has now gained popularity, a more likely scenario is that chimps and humans were infected by an HIV-1 precursor virus derived from a contaminated poliovaccine. The reason for the rapidity and ease of cross-species transfer of this precursor virus has not been elucidated. We hypothesize that the poliovaccine was passaged in a human diploid cell strain.”

Collective experiences of adventitious viruses of animal-derived raw materials and what can be done about them.
âContamination of animal-derived raw materials with viruses, mycoplasmas, bacteria and fungi is common. These contaminants can interfere with the diagnosis of viral infection, and vaccines produced using infected cell cultures could lead to seroconversion or disease in the vaccinated animal. The purity, safety and efficacy of viral vaccines requires testing of the ingredients, cell substrates and final product. Methods for detection of viruses, especially bovine viral diarrhea virus, in nutrient serum, cell cultures, seed viruses and viral vaccines, and the frequency of their detection at the Center for Veterinary Biologics are discussed.â

Donât ignore the risk of vaccine contamination
“Sir, Your News and Opinion articles about alleged contamination of vaccines should serve as a warning against over-optimism.
These articles highlight the failure to show any evidence for contamination of Wistar Institute polio vaccine stocks by human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV/SIV), and you appeal for a truce. But â although Edward Hooper is quoted as saying that “vaccine samples released did not include any from batches prepared for use in Africa” â lymphocytes have been detected in other polio vaccines. Half of the vervet monkeys in Southern Africa are SIV positive; these animals were used for preparing early polio vaccines.
Considering the many millions of vaccine doses prepared in primary vervet monkey kidney cultures over a 30-year period, it is inconceivable that some SIV did not contaminate many cultures. By the same yardstick, simian virus 40 (SV40) contaminated millions of doses of poliovirus vaccine until the animals were screened for this tumour virus.
Edward Hooper and others surely do not intend to undermine the polio vaccine efforts. What is needed is a new awareness of the need for caution â remembering the example of BSE â in view of the current impetus towards xenotransplantation and the accompanying danger of contamination. Our aim should be to improve our vaccines, not to undermine public confidence in them.”

Endogenous retroviruses as potential hazards for vaccines.
“Retroviruses are classified as exogenous or endogenous according to their mode of transmission. Generally, endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are not pathogenic in their original hosts; however, some ERVs induce diseases. In humans, a novel gammaretrovirus was discovered in patients with prostate cancer or chronic fatigue syndrome. This virus was closely related to xenotropic murine leukemia virus (X-MLV) and designated as xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV). The origin and transmission route of XMRV are still unknown at present; however, XMRV may be derived from ERVs of rodents because X-MLVs are ERVs of inbred and wild mice. Many live attenuated vaccines for animals are manufactured by using cell lines from animals, which are known to produce infectious ERVs; however, the risks of infection by ERVs from xenospecies through vaccination have been ignored. This brief review gives an overview of ERVs in cats, the potential risks of ERV infection by vaccination, the biological characteristics of RD-114 virus (a feline ERV), which possibly contaminates vaccines for companion animals, and the methods for detection of infectious RD-114 virus.

Experience with preparation an laboratory control of oral poliomyelitis vaccine in Czechoslovakia.
“Among the many problems connected with the preparation and laboratory control of oral poliomyelitis vaccines, one of the most vexed is that of the presence of undesirable, extraneous viruses of simian origin, particularly the foamy viruses. In Czechoslovakia, as elsewhere, these have been encountered in the production of live poliomyelitis vaccine from Sabin strains. Of 596 single lots of primary monkey kidney cell cultures intended for use in vaccine, only 143 lots successfully passed laboratory control tests, mainly because foamy viruses were found. Comparison tests showed that monkey and rabbit kidney cells were equally sensitive for the detection of foamy viruses but that dog kidney cells were less so and, in addition, in 8% of cases contained endogenous cytopathogenic virus agents. The presence of vacuolating agent was not tested for in the control tests discussed in this paper.All vaccine lots which passed control tests and were administered to children in the course of mass vaccination campaigns in Czechoslovakia in 1960 and 1961 proved safe and effective.”

ð  Experimental oral polio vaccines and acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
The simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) of the common chimpanzee is widely acknowledged as the direct ancestor of HIV-1. There is increasing historical evidence that during the late 1950s, kidneys were routinely excised from central African chimpanzees by scientists who were collaborating with the polio vaccine research of Dr Hilary Koprowski, and sent - inter alia - to vaccine-making laboratories in the USA and Africa, and to unspecified destinations in Belgium. While there is no direct evidence that cells from these kidneys were used as a substrate for growing Dr Koprowskiâs oral polio vaccines, there is a startling coincidence between places in Africa where his CHAT vaccine was fed, and the first appearances in the world of HIV-1 group M and group-M-related AIDS. Because of the enormous implications of the hypothesis that AIDS may be an unintended iatrogenic (physician-caused) disease, it is almost inevitable that this theory will engender heated opposition from many of those in the scientific establishment, and those with vested interests.

ð  Hepatitis B Vaccinesâto Switch or Not to Switch
“Shortly after the licensure of Heptavax-B in 1981 and its general availability in July 1982, the discovery of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) among male homosexuals threatened the success of this product, since some of the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive plasma donors were members of this high-risk group. Intensive epidemiologic, virological, and serological evaluations were launched, which eventually found no evidence for the transmission of AIDS to recipients of the plasma-derived HBsAg vaccine.”

The injection century: massive unsterile injections and the emergence of human pathogens.
“Unsterile medical injections are common in the less-developed world, where most visits to a doctor result in the (generally unnecessary) administration of intramuscular, or subcutaneous drugs. WHO estimates1 that every year unsafe injections result in 80 000â160 000 new HIV-1 infections, 8Â·16 million hepatitis B infections, and 2Â·3â4Â·7 million hepatitis C infections worldwide (this figure does not include transfusions). Together, these illnesses account for 1Â·3 million deaths and 23 million years of lost life.”

Jonathan Hutchinson on Vaccination Syphilis 
“A century ago, even as today, the opponents of compulsory vaccination for smallpox argued that the complications of the procedure might be worse than the disease. One of the most resolute advocates of compulsory vaccination at the time was Jonathan Hutchinson, then a newly elected honorary member of the New York Dermatological society. Hutchinson made no secret of his contempt for the misguided zealots who supported the antivaccination movement. One may well imagine, therefore, how painful it must have been for him to report in detail his findings on the transmission of syphilis by arm-to-arm vaccination. Hutchinson met the problem with characteristic courage. How he did so is summarized in this article.”

Live oral poliovirus vaccines and simian cytomegalovirus.
“Live oral poliovirus vaccines (OPV) are often produced in primary Cercopithecus monkey kidney (CMK) cells. The kidneys of these monkeys are often latently infected with simian cytomegalovirus (SCMV), and CMK cultures are frequently contaminated with SCMV. We tested human, monkey and rabbit tissue culture systems, and found that MRC-5 cells are most sensitive for detection of SCMV. To address the question of whether OPV could be contaminated with infectious SCMV, we inoculated MRC-5 cells with neutralized OPV manufactured in the United States between 1972 and 1998. Infectious SCMV was not found in any of the vaccine lots tested. We also used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to search for SCMV DNA in live oral poliovirus vaccines; SCMV DNA sequences were found in several of the vaccine lots manufactured prior to 1992.”

Mortality and morbidity among military personnel and civilians during the 1930s and World War II from transmission of hepatitis during yellow fever vaccination: systematic review.
“During World War II, nearly all US and Allied troops received yellow fever vaccine. Until May 1942, it was both grown and suspended in human serum. In April 1942, major epidemics of hepatitis occurred in US and Allied troops who had received yellow fever vaccine. A rapid and thorough investigation by the US surgeon general followed, and a directive was issued discontinuing the use of human serum in vaccine production. The large number of cases of hepatitis caused by the administration of this vaccine could have been avoided. Had authorities undertaken a thorough review of the literature, they would have discovered published reports, as early as 1885, of postvaccination epidemics of hepatitis in both men and horses. It would take 4 additional decades of experiments and epidemiological research before viruses of hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E were identified, their modes of transmission understood, and their genomes sequenced.”

Multiple sclerosis and hepatitis B vaccination: could minute contamination of the vaccine by partial hepatitis B virus polymerase play a role through molecular mimicry?
“Reports of multiple sclerosis developing after hepatitis B vaccination have led to the concern that this vaccine might be a cause of multiple sclerosis in previously healthy subjects. Some articles evidenced that minor Hepatitis B virus (HBV) polymerase proteins could be produced by alternative transcriptional or translational strategies. Their detection is very difficult because they are in minute concentration and probably enzymatically inactive, however, it was shown that they could be exposed on the outside of the virus particles and also be immunogenic. In addition, HBV polymerase shares significant amino acid similarities with the human myelin basic protein. We hypothesise that some of the apparent adverse reactions to the vaccine could be due to a process called of molecular mimicry, the HBV polymerase, which could be a contaminant in the recombinant or plasma-derived vaccines, could act as autoantigens and induce autoimmune demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis.”

Of Mice and Men: On the Origin of XMRV.
“The novel human retrovirus xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) is arguably the most controversial virus of this moment. After its original discovery in prostate cancer tissue from North American patients, it was subsequently detected in individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome from the same continent. However, most other research groups, mainly from Europe, reported negative results. The positive results could possibly be attributed to contamination with mouse products in a number of cases, as XMRV is nearly identical in nucleotide sequence to endogenous retroviruses in the mouse genome. But the detection of integrated XMRV proviruses in prostate cancer tissue proves it to be a genuine virus that replicates in human cells, leaving the question: how did XMRV enter the human population? We will discuss two possible routes: either via direct virus transmission from mouse to human, as repeatedly seen for, e.g., Hantaviruses, or via the use of mouse-related products by humans, including vaccines. We hypothesize that mouse cells or human cell lines used for vaccine production could have been contaminated with a replicating variant of the XMRV precursors encoded by the mouse genome.”

ð  Oral polio vaccine and human cancer: a reassessment of SV40 as a contaminant based upon legal documents.
“The confirmation of the removal by one drug manufacturer, Lederle, has been made public at an international symposium in January 1997, where its representatives stated that all of Lederleâs seeds had been tested and screened to assure that it was free from SV40 virus. However, in litigation involving the Lederle oral polio vaccine, the manufacturerâs internal documents failed to reveal such removal in all of the seeds. The absence of confirmatory testing of the seeds, as well as testimony of a Lederle manager, indicate that this claim of removal of SV40 and the testing for SV40 in all the seeds cannot be fully substantiated. These legal documents and testimony indicate that the scientific community should not be content with prior assumptions that SV40 could not have been in the oral polio vaccine.”

ð  Polio, hepatitis B and AIDS: an integrative theory on a possible vaccine induced pandemic.
“The hypothesis that simian virus 40 (SV40) infected polio vaccines may be linked to the evolution of acquired immunodeficiency disorder (AIDS), and certain cancers, has been advanced. Most recently, investigators discussed the likelihood of gene-reshuffling following SV40 infection as a precursor to acquired immune dysfunction. Findings of recent SV40 infections in four children born after 1982 suggest infections were transmitted vertically along gene lines. Earlier observations proved activation of a retrovirus gene by a hepatitis B virus (HBV) protein. This paper proposes a new integrative theory on the origin of AIDS. It advances the possibility of genetic recombinations with oncogene activation by HBV involving simian viruses that likely infected polio vaccinated blood donors to the initial hepatitis B (HB) vaccine trials conducted on gay men in New York City and Ugandan Blacks in the early to mid-1970s. The socio-economic and even military ramifications associated with this politically challenging thesis are discussed.”

Polio vaccines and the origin of AIDS.
“In particular, it is now known that the early polio vaccines were contaminated with at least one monkey virus, SV40. The transfer of monkey viruses to man via contaminated vaccines is particularly relevant to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), since the causative agent of AIDS, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is thought to be derived from a simian precursor virus. Furthermore, human infection with this virus appears to be a relatively recent event. We hypothesize that the AIDS pandemic may have originated with a contaminated polio vaccine that was administered to inhabitants of Equatorial Africa from 1957 to 1959. The mechanism of evolution of HIV from this vaccine remains to be determined.”

Porcine circovirus (PCV) removal by Q sepharose fast flow chromatography. 
“The recently discovered contamination of oral rotavirus vaccines led to exposure of millions of infants to porcine circovirus (PCV). PCV was not detected by conventional virus screening tests. Regulatory agencies expect exclusion of adventitious viruses from biological products. Therefore, methods for inactivation/removal of viruses have to be implemented as an additional safety barrier whenever feasible. However, inactivation or removal of PCV is difficult. PCV is highly resistant to widely used physicochemical inactivation procedures. Circoviruses such as PCV are the smallest viruses known and are not expected to be effectively removed by currently-used virus filters due to the small size of the circovirus particles. Anion exchange chromatography such as Q Sepharose(Â®) Fast Flow (QSFF) has been shown to effectively remove a range of viruses including parvoviruses. In this study, we investigated PCV1 removal by virus filtration and by QSFF chromatography. As expected, PCV1 could not be effectively removed by virus filtration. However, PCV1 could be effectively removed by QSFF as used during the purification of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and a log10 reduction value (LRV) of 4.12 was obtained.

The Risk of AIDS After Hepatitis Vaccination
“In the recent decision analysis article by Sacks et al1 in the Dec 28, 1984, issue of The Journal, the authors claim to have calculated the maximum rate of hepatitis B vaccine-induced acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) to be eight per 100,000 with 95% confidence. This calculation is based on a study of 40,000 persons who had been vaccinated prior to mid-1982. I do not believe that an extrapolation from this population can be expected to hold true for a vaccine manufactured from todayâs pool of donors.”

Should the risk of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome deter hepatitis B vaccination? A decision analysis.
“The current epidemic of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and fear that its causative agent contaminates the currently available hepatitis B vaccine may have deterred vaccine use. We formulated a decision-analytic model that compares the risk of death from hepatitis B and AIDS in those vaccinated with the risk of death from hepatitis B alone in those who wait two years for a synthetic vaccine. For individuals with 5% annual risk of hepatitis B, the best current estimate is that vaccination now would save 25 lives per 100,000. The best current estimate of the rate of vaccine-induced AIDS is zero, and one can be 95% confident that the rate is less than eight per 100,000. The rate would have to be considerably higher before postponement of vaccination would be rational for those for whom vaccination has been recommended.”

Simian cytomegalovirus and contamination of oral poliovirus vaccines.
“In the 1950s the use of primary rhesus macaque kidney cultures to propagate poliovirus for vaccine production led to the contamination of vaccines with simian virus 40 (SV40). African green monkey kidney (AGMK) cultures free of SV40 were used as an alternative cell substrate for vaccine manufacture. In this study we evaluate oral poliovirus seeds, vaccine bulks and vaccines themselves for the presence of a common contaminant of AGMK cultures, simian cytomegalovirus (SCMV). Using sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques, nearly half of the samples analysed were found to be contaminated with SCMV sequences. However, vaccine bulks, positive by PCR for SCMV failed to show any evidence of infectious virus in these studies. One poliovirus vaccine and one seed, propagated on rhesus macaque kidney cultures were found to be positive for the rhesus monkey CMV by PCR.”

Simian cytomegalovirus-related stealth virus isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of a patient with bipolar psychosis and acute encephalopathy.
“A cytopathic ‘stealthâ virus was cultured from the cerebrospinal fluid of a patient with a bipolar psychotic disorder who developed a severe encephalopathy leading to a vegetative state. DNA sequencing of a polymerase chain reaction-amplified product from infected cultures has identified the virus as an African green monkey simian cytomegalovirus (SCMV)-related stealth virus. The virus is similar to the SCMV-related stealth virus isolated from a patient with chronic fatigue syndrome. The findings support the concepts that stealth viruses can account for a spectrum of dysfunctional brain diseases and that some of these viruses may have arisen from live polio viral vaccines.”

Some oral poliovirus vaccines were contaminated with infectious SV40 after 1961.
“Some polio vaccines prepared from 1954 to 1961 were contaminated with infectious SV40. It has been assumed that all polio vaccines were SV40 free in the United States after 1961 and in other countries after 1962. Following a WHO requirement that was prompted by the detection of SV40 in some human tumors, we conducted a multilaboratory study to test for SV40 polio vaccines prepared after 1961. Vaccine samples from 13 countries and the WHO seed were initially tested by PCR. The possible presence of intact and/or infectious SV40 DNA in PCR-positive samples was tested by transfection and infection of permissive CV-1 cells. All results were verified by immunohistochemistry, cloning, and sequencing. All the vaccines were SV40 free, except for vaccines from a major eastern European manufacturer that contained infectious SV40. We determined that the procedure used by this manufacturer to inactivate SV40 in oral poliovirus vaccine seed stocks based on heat inactivation in the presence of MgCl2 did not completely inactivate SV40. These SV40-contaminated vaccines were produced from early 1960s to about 1978 and were used throughout the world. Our findings underscore the potential risks of using primary monkey cells for preparing poliovirus vaccines, because of the possible contamination with SV40 or other monkey viruses, and emphasize the importance of using well-characterized cell substrates that are free from adventitious agents. Moreover, our results indicate possible geographic differences in SV40 exposure and offer a possible explanation for the different percentage of SV40-positive tumors detected in some laboratories.”

[SV40 as a possible cofactor in the etiopathogenesis of mesothelioma and other human tumors].
“Simian virus 40 (SV40) has been introduced into the human population with contaminated polio vaccines between 1955 and 1963. Previous research conducted by southern blot hybridization and recent analysis by PCR have shown the presence of SW0 sequences in human brain tumors, mesotheliomas and osteosarcomas as well as in normal tissues such as blood and sperm fluids. SV40 RNA and T antigen were detected in the same tissues. All the samples were coinfected by BK Virus (BKV), suggesting that BKV may have a helper function for SV40 replication in human cells. The presence of SV40 in human tumors suggests that the virus may be a cofactor in the etiopathogenesis of human neoplasia. In addition, blood and semen may represent the vectors for transmission of SV40 by horizontal infection in the human population.”

Testing for viral contaminants of veterinary vaccines in Hungary.
“The safety of veterinary vaccines is of paramount importance and it is significantly jeopardised by extraneous agents such as bacteria, mycoplasma, Chlamydia and viruses. Several critical steps of vaccine manufacture involve a potential risk of viral contamination. Viruses, as extraneous, agents can be divided into two main groups. Group 1 agents, such as Pestivirus, chicken anaemia virus (CAV), and egg drop syndrome virus (EDSV) are well-known to manufacturers and authorities. Compendial detection methods, clear guidelines and legislation have been established to minimise the risk of contamination with these agents. Contrary to group 1, group 2 agents like Torque Teno virus (TTV) or RD114, a replication-competent feline gamma-retrovirus, have only recently been recognised and their role as contaminants needs further investigation. Randomly selected veterinary vaccines used between 1992 and 2009 were tested by nucleic acid amplification for CAV, EDSV, and TTV. Pestivirus contamination was examined in 33 vaccines used between 1996 and 2006 and a further 27 vaccines used between 2007 and 2009 based on random selection of these vaccines. In addition to random tests done on vaccines used from 2007 on, 12 batches of live Aujeszkyâs disease vaccines submitted to our laboratory for Official Control Authority Batch Release (OCABR) were also tested for Pestivirus.”

ð  Tetanus vaccine may be laced with anti-fertility drug. International / developing countries.
“A priest, president of Human Life International (HLI) based in Maryland, has asked Congress to investigate reports of women in some developing countries unknowingly receiving a tetanus vaccine laced with the anti-fertility drug human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). If it is true, he wants Congress to publicly condemn the mass vaccinations and to cut off funding to UN agencies and other involved organizations. The natural hormone hCG is needed to maintain pregnancy. The hormone would produce antibodies against hCG to prevent pregnancy. In the fall of 1994, the Pro Life Committee of Mexico was suspicious of the protocols for the tetanus toxoid campaign because they excluded all males and children and called for multiple injections of the vaccine in only women of reproductive age. Yet, one injection provides protection for at least 10 years. The Committee had vials of the tetanus vaccine analyzed for hCG. It informed HLI about the tetanus toxoid vaccine. HLI then told its World Council members and HLI affiliates in more than 60 countries. Similar tetanus vaccines laced with hCG have been uncovered in the Philippines and in Nicaragua. In addition to the World Health Organization (WHO), other organizations involved in the development of an anti-fertility vaccine using hCG include the UN Population Fund, the UN Development Programme, the World Bank, the Population Council, the Rockefeller Foundation, the US National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, and Uppsala, Helsinki, and Ohio State universities. The priest objects that, if indeed the purpose of the mass vaccinations is to prevent pregnancies, women are uninformed, unsuspecting, and unconsenting victims.”

Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies: vaccine issues.
“The recent emergence of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) suggests that transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) pose an ongoing threat to human and animal health. To avoid iatrogenic transmission of TSEs in vaccines, strategies must be developed to obviate TSE agent infectivity in cellular substrates, cell culture media components and enzymes, and excipients, and to validate the safety of these components and field vaccines efficiently.”

The XIX century smallpox prevention in Naples and the risk of transmission of human blood-related pathogens.
“Although Galbiati established the retro-vaccination (1803) and developed the “calf” lymph vaccine, recognized and implemented since 1864 as the optimal smallpox vaccine in the following hundred years, Naples general population was mainly vaccinated with “human” lymph from abandoned children until 1893. Mini-epidemics of syphilis and serum hepatitis were periodically reported as results of arm-to-arm procedure. The risk of transmission of blood-related pathogens was higher in Naples where &gt;80% of abandoned children, used as repository of cowpox virus, were dying in their first year of life.”

The Anatomy of Research Scandals. 2017.
“For the past two years, I have taught a seminar on medical research scandals. The syllabus looks like a highlight reel of exploitation and abuse: children fed plutonium-laced breakfast cereal, prisoners dosed with the active ingredient in Agent Orange, mental patients given psychedelic drugs and massive electroconvulsive therapy before being sent into curare-induced paralysis and a coma. I designed the seminar to crush the idealism of future physicians by illuminating the dark patterns that research scandals typically follow. The most recent scandal we examined happened to be one of the most lurid.

Anatomy in the Third Reich: an outline, part 3. The science and ethics of anatomy in National Socialist Germany and postwar consequences.
“Not the individual human being but the “body of the people” as a whole was the object of this ethics. Every action was ethical that ensured the health of the German people, including sterilization, so-called euthanasia, and finally mass murder.”

🛑 The clinicide phenomenon: an exploration of medical murder
“The study of medical killers is barely in its infancy. Clinicide is the unnatural death of multiple patients in the course of treatment by a doctor. Serial medical killing is a relatively new phenomenon. The role model is Dr Marcel Petiot, the worst serial killer in French history. More recently, Dr Harold Shipman was Britain’s worst serial killer and in the United States and Zimbabwe, Dr Michael Swango killed 60 patients. A number of doctors have such high patient death rates that it cannot be ignored. At some level, these doctors have an awareness of what they are doing, countered by an overweening refusal to acknowledge the implications or desist from further treatment. Treatment killer offences usually occur on the basis of serial mental illness, but may include the contentious area of euthanasia killing. Doctors have frequently been accomplices in state repression, brutality and genocide in direct contravention to their sanctioned role to relieve suffering and save life. They have become mass murderers on an exponential scale, making any comparison with a doctor killing his own patients almost risible. Many clinicidal doctors have extreme narcissistic personalities, a grandiose view of their own capability and inability to accept that they could be criticized or need assistance from other doctors. Such doctors develop a God-complex, getting a vicarious thrill out of ending suffering and by determining when a person dies.”

Closed Financial Loops: When They Happen in Government, They’re Called Corruption; in Medicine, They’re Just a Footnote. (2017)
“Many physicians are involved in relationships that create tension between a physician’s duty to work in her patients’ best interest at all times and her financial arrangement with a third party, most often a pharmaceutical manufacturer, whose primary goal is maximizing sales or profit. Despite the prevalence of this threat, in the United States and globally, the most common reaction to conflicts of interest in medicine is timid acceptance. There are few calls for conflicts of interest to be banned, and, to our knowledge, no one calls for conflicted practitioners to be reprimanded. Contrast our attitudes in medicine with public attitudes toward financial conflicts among government employees. When enforcement of rules against conflict of interest slackens in the public sector, news organizations investigate and publish their criticism. Yet even when doctors are quoted in the media promoting specific drugs, their personal financial ties to the drug maker are rarely mentioned. Policies for governmental employees are strict, condemnation is strong, and criminal statutes exist (allowing for corruption charges). Yet the evidence that conflict is problematic is, if anything, stronger in medicine than in the public sector. Policies against conflicts of interest in medicine should be at least as strong as those already existing in the public sector.

🛑 Conflicts of interest in research involving human beings.
“Conflicts of interest are inherent to the majority of relationships among individuals and of these with companies and institutions and, certainly, research involving human beings is no exception. In relation to clinical research, the main focus of this manuscript, conflicts of interest occur at different levels and usually permeate among them: In the pharmaceutical industry in their decisions to invest to develop new products, especially vaccines and drugs, and also in relation to marketing of these products;”

Corruption in healthcare and medicine: why should physicians and bioethicists care and what should they do?
“Quality care cannot be provided by a healthcare delivery system in which kickbacks and bribery are a part of life. The medical profession, historically considered a noble one, and the bioethics community cannot evade their moral responsibility in the face of this sordid reality. There is a need to engage in public discussions and take a stand - against unethical and corrupt practices in healthcare and medicine - for the sake of the individual’s well-being as well as for social good.”

Dishonesty, misconduct and fraud in clinical research: an international problem.
“Clinical research misdemeanours include a broad spectrum of misdeeds that misappropriate an unfair advantage or harm the rights of others. There is no internationally accepted definition of such malpractices and no generalized procedure to facilitate their reporting or correction. Those who do report research misdemeanours are often stigmatized as ‘whistleblowers’, a term that has acquired many negative connotations. Frequently, whistleblowers encounter many personal conflicts and/or may suffer victimization in their working environment. There remains a need for an internationally harmonized approach to manage these unacceptable problems. Resolution of such important issues should be catalysed by the impending need for European Union states to implement Good Clinical Practice Directive 2001/20/EC into national law.”

[“Euthanasia”-victims and test subjects. The fate of diseased, disabled children in Berlin during World War II].
“This article shows, through a study of the Berlin-Brandenburg region, that children and juveniles who were subjected to the killings of diseased and disabled, or mentally retarded, persons during the Third Reich did not only fall victim to the operations of the “Reichsausschuss” (“Reich Commission for Registration of Severe Disorders in Childhood”). Many were also included in the gas chamber killings of the “T4”-action and in various decentralized killing actions. Furthermore, the co-operation of various medical disciplines in the misuse of children for scientific research is demonstrated by looking into the research on a tuberculosis vaccine. It can be shown that the purpose of the killings was not the painless ending of individual suffering, but that they constituted a means of freeing the public from so-called “ballast existences”, whose lives were only prolonged if they could be of scientific use.”

Fraud and deceit in clinical research 
“CONCLUSION
In conclusion, evidently there are a number of reasons why research misconduct takes place: Academic pressure, personal desire for fame, “sloppy” science, financial gain, and an inability to determine right from wrong, to name a few. This demonstrates a need for a new system of prevention, investigation, and education to curtail research misconduct, therefore instilling, into the general public, a renewed sense of trust and respect for medical research.
In order to prevent research misconduct, further discussion of its definition and its various facets is needed, therefore resulting in an international consensus on a single, universal definition of what constitutes research misconduct. Additionally, ethical standards need to be made clear so that researchers can determine whether their work breaches certain codes. Furthermore, there needs to be an alleviation of pressure on researchers, as well as greater control of research sponsored by outside organizations.
Moreover, organizations’ investigation into research irregularities must be fair, prompt, transparent, and allow for retractions to be made promptly once evidence of misconduct has been confirmed. Also, there needs to be greater protection for whistleblowers, as well as ensuring a right of appeal. The investigation can be conducted at either institutional or national level, depending on the gravity of misconduct. However, organizations need to be equipped with effective resources and a certain status in the wider community, thereby ensuring public confidence.
Lastly, there is a desperate need for researchers and future researchers to be educated on what constitutes research misconduct, and the seriousness of its repercussions. There is limited publicity and information of the regulatory bodies in medical institutions and places of work. It has been almost 25 years since Lock suggested a closer look at this issue,[40] yet we are still faced with cases of fraud on an epic scale.[41] It may be too late to change the ways of our seniors,[32] but we have a responsibility to our nations to act. As Martinson et al. stated, “it is time to consider what aspects of the research environment are most salient to research integrity, which aspects are most amendable to change, and what changes are likely to be most fruitful in ensuring integrity in science.”[7] Educating potential researchers at an early stage (e.g. at medical school) on the mechanics of research ethics is essential to finding a solution to this problem and ensuring careers are constructed on honesty and integrity.”

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines as an option for preventing cervical malignancies: (how) effective and safe?
“We carried out a systematic review of HPV vaccine pre- and post-licensure trials to assess the evidence of their effectiveness and safety. We find that HPV vaccine clinical trials design, and data interpretation of both efficacy and safety outcomes, were largely inadequate. Additionally, we note evidence of selective reporting of results from clinical trials (i.e., exclusion of vaccine efficacy figures related to study subgroups in which efficacy might be lower or even negative from peer-reviewed publications). Given this, the widespread optimism regarding HPV vaccines long-term benefits appears to rest on a number of unproven assumptions (or such which are at odd with factual evidence) and significant misinterpretation of available data. For example, the claim that HPV vaccination will result in approximately 70% reduction of cervical cancers is made despite the fact that the clinical trials data have not demonstrated to date that the vaccines have actually prevented a single case of cervical cancer (let alone cervical cancer death), nor that the current overly optimistic surrogate marker-based extrapolations are justified. Likewise, the notion that HPV vaccines have an impressive safety profile is only supported by highly flawed design of safety trials and is contrary to accumulating evidence from vaccine safety surveillance databases and case reports which continue to link HPV vaccination to serious adverse outcomes (including death and permanent disabilities). We thus conclude that further reduction of cervical cancers might be best achieved by optimizing cervical screening (which carries no such risks) and targeting other factors of the disease rather than by the reliance on vaccines with questionable efficacy and safety profiles.”

🛑 Medicine, the media and monetary interests: the need for transparency and professionalism.
“Emerging evidence suggests that media coverage of medicine is increasingly promotional in nature. Recent Australian examples include misleading newspaper articles on an experimental cancer vaccine and a high profile television current affairs segment on a new influenza drug, which failed to disclose the industry ties of a key expert featured in the report. There are widening concerns that this problem in medical journalism may be exacerbated by the growing commercialisation of medical and scientific research, and the increasing ties between researchers, doctors and pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies. Closer links between industry and medicine are being explicitly encouraged both in academia and the health care sector for the mutual benefits they bring. However, these partnerships are the cause of growing unease within medicine. In the United States, rigorous legislation governing research protocols is being proposed, and in Australia new ethical guidelines covering industry-profession relationships are being promulgated. If one of the media’s roles is informing the community about the business of health and medicine in a fair and accurate way, a cultural change in medical journalism is required.”

🛑 Oral polio vaccine and human cancer: a reassessment of SV40 as a contaminant based upon legal documents. 
“The confirmation of the removal by one drug manufacturer, Lederle, has been made public at an international symposium in January 1997, where its representatives stated that all of Lederle’s seeds had been tested and screened to assure that it was free from SV40 virus. However, in litigation involving the Lederle oral polio vaccine, the manufacturer’s internal documents failed to reveal such removal in all of the seeds. The absence of confirmatory testing of the seeds, as well as testimony of a Lederle manager, indicate that this claim of removal of SV40 and the testing for SV40 in all the seeds cannot be fully substantiated. These legal documents and testimony indicate that the scientific community should not be content with prior assumptions that SV40 could not have been in the oral polio vaccine.”

Our prescription drugs kill us in large numbers.
“Our prescription drugs are the third leading cause of death after heart disease and cancer in the United States and Europe. Around half of those who die have taken their drugs correctly; the other half die because of errors, such as too high a dose or use of a drug despite contraindications. Our drug agencies are not particularly helpful, as they rely on fake fixes, which are a long list of warnings, precautions, and contraindications for each drug, although they know that no doctor can possibly master all of these. Major reasons for the many drug deaths are impotent drug regulation, widespread crime that includes corruption of the scientific evidence about drugs and bribery of doctors, and lies in drug marketing, which is as harmful as tobacco marketing and, therefore, should be banned. We should take far fewer drugs, and patients should carefully study the package inserts of the drugs their doctors prescribe for them and independent information sources about drugs such as Cochrane reviews, which will make it easier for them to say “no thanks”.”

Parents in Pakistan arrested for polio vaccine refusal: a necessary step? 2015 
“Pakistan’s vaccination drive against polio has encountered many adversities in the past few years. The vaccination drive received hostility from militant groups when it was used as cover to spy on Taliban hideouts. In retaliation, extremist groups have killed about 60 polio vaccine workers, which further hindered progress of the vaccine drive.1 Additionally, some in the general population have misconceptions about the vaccine. Until now, the government has not taken a hard line, which is necessary to control this issue.
On March 2, 2015, police in Khyber–Pakhtunkhwa province, Pakistan, arrested more than 450 parents after they refused to vaccinate their children against polio virus because of some religious fears and myths associated with vaccination (such as sterilisation).2, 3 The parents later signed an agreement to cooperate in administration of the polio vaccine to their children. The police felt the need to intervene because the number of polio cases in the province had increased by 96% in the previous year.2 In Khyber–Pakhtunkhwa province, parents have repeatedly refused to vaccinate their children against polio in the past. In 2015 alone, thousands of children aged less than 5 years have been deprived of the vaccine because their parents refused. Hundreds of refusals are reported in the city of Peshawar alone.”

Quiet killings in medical facilities: detection &amp; prevention.
“Excerpt
The purpose of this article is to prompt a public discussion concerning the “quiet killings” that have occurred and are occurring in our medical facilities, hopefully leading to a robust debate over improving methods of detecting and preventing such killings. The importance of this subject cannot be overstated, particularly in light of the ever-increasing numbers of people who will be admitted to, or living in, medical facilities as the first of the “baby boom” generation reaches age sixty-five in the year 2011 1 and the number of employees who have routine access to these patients or residents. In 2000, hospital admissions were over thirty-three million 2 and in 1999 nursing homes had 1.7 million residents. 3 Hospital employees number over four million and nursing home employees another 1.8 million. 4 To these institutions and people having access may be added the residents of homes licensed to dispense medication and all of the visitors to all of the facilities.
The article will provide evidence of these quiet killings, define the scope of the problem they present, discuss some problems in detecting, investigating and prosecuting these killings, and suggest methods for detecting and preventing the killings. 5 Not only will the implementation of methods for detecting and preventing such killings save lives, such activity will save the reputation (and financial resources) of health care professionals and medical facilities by reducing their exposure to civil and criminal liability.

Serious adverse events after HPV vaccination: a critical review of randomized trials and post-marketing case series.
Martínez-Lavín M, et al. Clin Rheumatol. 2017.
“This article critically reviews HPV vaccine serious adverse events described in pre-licensure randomized trials and in post-marketing case series. HPV vaccine randomized trials were identified in PubMed. Safety data were extracted. Post-marketing case series describing HPV immunization adverse events were reviewed. Most HPV vaccine randomized trials did not use inert placebo in the control group. Two of the largest randomized trials found significantly more severe adverse events in the tested HPV vaccine arm of the study. Compared to 2871 women receiving aluminum placebo, the group of 2881 women injected with the bivalent HPV vaccine had more deaths on follow-up (14 vs. 3, p = 0.012). Compared to 7078 girls injected with the 4-valent HPV vaccine, 7071 girls receiving the 9-valent dose had more serious systemic adverse events (3.3 vs. 2.6%, p = 0.01). For the 9-valent dose, our calculated number needed to seriously harm is 140 (95% CI, 796-53). The number needed to vaccinate is 1757 (95% CI, 131 to infinity). Practically, none of the serious adverse events occurring in any arm of both studies were judged to be vaccine-related. Pre-clinical trials, post-marketing case series, and the global drug adverse reaction database (VigiBase) describe similar post-HPV immunization symptom clusters. Two of the largest randomized HPV vaccine trials unveiled more severe adverse events in the tested HPV vaccine arm of the study. Nine-valent HPV vaccine has a worrisome number needed to vaccinate/number needed to harm quotient. Pre-clinical trials and post-marketing case series describe similar post-HPV immunization symptoms.”

[“…. sustaining their lives has no advantage to the nation.” Handicapped children as research subjects and the development of preventive tuberculosis vaccination].
“A large number of disabled or mentally retarded children were killed in the so-called “Children’s Special Departments” of the “Third Reich”. Such children were also misused in scientific research. Ambitious physicians in the “Children’s Special Departments” experimented on them in co-operation with other institutions. This happened, for example, in research on the tuberculosis vaccine. The effectiveness of the BCG-vaccine was primarily tested at the Children’s University Hospital of Vienna. Disabled children were first given the BCG-vaccine and then deliberately contaminated with tuberculosis bacteria. Subsequently they were transferred to Vienna’s “Children’s Special Department” in order to be killed there. The efficacy of vaccination was supposed to be demonstrable in their autopsies. Vaccine experiments were also carried out in the “Children’s Special Departments” of Berlin and Kaufbeuren. There were likewise co-operations with other institutions.”

🛑 Tetanus vaccine may be laced with anti-fertility drug. International / developing countries.
“A priest, president of Human Life International (HLI) based in Maryland, has asked Congress to investigate reports of women in some developing countries unknowingly receiving a tetanus vaccine laced with the anti-fertility drug human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). If it is true, he wants Congress to publicly condemn the mass vaccinations and to cut off funding to UN agencies and other involved organizations. The natural hormone hCG is needed to maintain pregnancy. The hormone would produce antibodies against hCG to prevent pregnancy. In the fall of 1994, the Pro Life Committee of Mexico was suspicious of the protocols for the tetanus toxoid campaign because they excluded all males and children and called for multiple injections of the vaccine in only women of reproductive age. Yet, one injection provides protection for at least 10 years. The Committee had vials of the tetanus vaccine analyzed for hCG. It informed HLI about the tetanus toxoid vaccine. HLI then told its World Council members and HLI affiliates in more than 60 countries. Similar tetanus vaccines laced with hCG have been uncovered in the Philippines and in Nicaragua. In addition to the World Health Organization (WHO), other organizations involved in the development of an anti-fertility vaccine using hCG include the UN Population Fund, the UN Development Programme, the World Bank, the Population Council, the Rockefeller Foundation, the US National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, and Uppsala, Helsinki, and Ohio State universities. The priest objects that, if indeed the purpose of the mass vaccinations is to prevent pregnancies, women are uninformed, unsuspecting, and unconsenting victims.”

To tell or not to tell? The ethical dilemma of the would-be whistleblower.
“Despite the growing emphasis placed on the responsible conduct of research, little attention has been devoted to the question of what an individual should do upon discovering research misconduct. This article takes seriously the dilemma of a would-be whistleblower. It identifies ethical considerations that can be taken into account in moral decision-making about reporting research misconduct. It also offers rough guidelines about the moral significance of each consideration in the decision-making process based on the facts of the case in question. The article, therefore, offers tools for a would-be whistleblower to use to arrive at a defensible resolution to a difficult dilemma.”

The use of fetal bovine serum: ethical or scientific problem?
“Fetal bovine serum (FBS) is a common component of animal cell culture media. It is harvested from bovine fetuses taken from pregnant cows during slaughter. FBS is commonly harvested by means of a cardiac puncture without any form of anaesthesia. Fetuses are probably exposed to pain and/or discomfort, so the current practice of fetal blood harvesting is inhumane. Apart from moral concerns, several scientific and technical problems exist with regard to the use of FBS in cell culture. Efforts should be made to reduce the use of FBS or, preferably, to replace it with synthetic alternatives.”

Vaccine-related serious adverse events might have been under-recognized in the pivotal HPV vaccine randomized trial (2017)
“To the Editor:
After seeing several healthy girls developing a severe chronic illness soon after HPV vaccination [1], I analyzed all HPV vaccine randomized controlled trials.
The overwhelming majority of pre-licensure HPV vaccine randomized trials did not use inert placebo as comparator. The largest nine-valent HPV immunization trial [2] compared the newly developed nine-valent HPV vaccine vs. the four-valent HPV formulation. The innovative nine-valent HPV dose has more than double HPV virus-like particles and aluminum adjuvant than the previous formulation. Double-blind safety analysis contrasted 7071 subjects immunized with the nine-valent vaccine vs. 7078 who had the four-valent dose. The nine-valent cohort had significantly more systemic serious adverse events; n = 233 (3.3%) vs. n = 183 (2.6%) in the other group. Our calculated 2 × 2 contingency table pvalue was 0.0125. Oddly, only two subjects (0%) in each group were judged to have a vaccine-related serious adverse event. The authors did not comment on this incongruity.
This discrepancy arising from a pivotal large randomized double-blind trial suggests that nine-valent HPV vaccine-related serious adverse events were under-recognized. This emerging information casts further doubt on HPV vaccine safety.”

🛑 White coated corruption.
“This essay documents the state of the medical profession which was once a respected line of work but today is corrupted at every level, from medical education to medical practice, and ir both the private and government sectors. It calls for doctors, thE government and the public to act against dishonest doctors restore the dignity of the profession and work for the benefit of society.

ð Adverse events associated with childhood vaccines other than pertussis and rubella. Summary of a report from the Institute of Medicine.
The committee found that the evidence favored acceptance of a causal relation between diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome and brachial neuritis, between measles vaccine and anaphylaxis, between oral polio vaccine and Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome, and between unconjugated Hib vaccine and susceptibility to Hib disease. The committee found that the evidence established causality between diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and anaphylaxis, between measles vaccine and death from measles vaccine-strain viral infection, between measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and thrombocytopenia and anaphylaxis, between oral polio vaccine and poliomyelitis and death from polio vaccine-strain viral infection, and between hepatitis B vaccine and anaphylaxis.

ð Are toxic biometals destroying your childrenâs future?
“Cadmium, arsenic, lead, and mercury have been linked to autism, attention deficit disorder, mental retardation and death of children. Mercury in thimerosal found in many vaccines and flu shots contributes significantly to these problems. Decomposition of the thimerosal can produce more toxic compounds, either methylethylmercury or diethylmercury, in the body. These compounds have a toxicity level similar to dimethylmercury. Within the human body, a mitochondrial disorder may release the more toxic form of mercury internally. Young children and pregnant women must minimize internal exposure to the vaccines and flu shots containing mercury.”

ð Beta-tryptase and quantitative mast-cell increase in a sudden infant death following hexavalent immunization.
“A fatal case of a 3-month-old female infant, who died within 24 h of vaccination with hexavalent vaccine is presented. Clinical data, post-mortem findings (acute pulmonary oedema, acute pulmonary emphysema), quali-quantitative data collected from immunohistochemical staining (degranulating mast cells) and laboratory analysis with a high level of beta-tryptase in serum, 43.3 microg/l, allows us to conclude that acute respiratory failure likely due to post hexavalent immunization-related shock was the cause of death.”

Beware of ‘lookalikesâ. (2017)
“In 2014, health staff who were vaccinating children in rebel-held northern Syria accidentally administered a muscle relaxant, atracurium, to up to 75 children, killing 15 of them. An investigation found that the drug was given to the children instead of a solution used to mix measles vaccines because the packaging was similar.”

âWe report four cases of ascending paralysis admitted to Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital (TASH) within six months period between December 2010 and June 2011 following administration of sheep brain tissue anti rabies vaccine for presumed rabies exposure. The paralysis started after a minimum of twelve doses of the vaccine. Two of the patients were discharged with severe paralysis and two died in the hospital.â

Characterisation of poxviruses from sporadic human infections.
“An orthopoxvirus was isolated from the vesicular rash of a man in Natal who died in coma and who had not been vaccinated. Analysis of the viral DNA showed that it was a vaccinia virus, more closely related to the virus of South African smallpox vaccine than to other vaccinia viruses.”
“Minor biological differences between the viruses isolated and the corresponding vaccine strains suggested that some natural transmission of the virus had occurred, but the results of DNA analysis implied that they originated from the use of smallpox vaccine.”

ð [Complications of pertussis immunization (author transl)].
“16 cases of neurological disease and/or death shortly after pertussis immunization are reported. Eight patients had convulsions, six with ensuing permanent defects. Severe polymyositis was observed in one case. Five infants died 12 h to 4 days after vaccination: two after acute encephalopathy and three in the form of a sudden unexpected death (SID). In two fatal cases the morphological changes in the brain corresponded to those of pertussis encephalopathy: neuronal degeneration in various parts of the cortex, especially in the region of the ammons horn, and in the cerebellum. There were no signs of inflammation. Three cases underwent forensic autopsy and death was attributed to bronchopulmonary infection. Complete neuropathological work-up was only done in one case, in which the brain was normal. The critique of episodical reports and the demand for prospective studies is appreciated. Knowledge of all possible forms of complications, however, is indispensable for future investigations. Polymyositis and SID have so far not been listed as abnormal reactions to immunization. The majority of our cases became known accidentally from hospital sheets or from discussions with collegues. For a detection of all possible cases a greater awareness of doctors for the problem of pertussis immunization appears necessary. Only another 23 cases have been reported to the health authorities of the state of Lower Saxony during the last 6 to 7 years. Of those, nine were either harmless reactions or diseases probably unrelated to vaccination. Two were cases of SID, 12 and 72 h after vaccination. It is concluded that only a minor proportion of possible complications is presently reported to the health authorities.”

Confusing drug packaging contributes to death of 15 children.
“At least 15 children have died after being vaccinated against measles in northern Syria, owing to accidental injection of atracurium.1 The seriousness of this particular event is compounded by the fact that the deaths were associated with vaccination in a population in the midst of civil war whose trust in western medicine is already fragile.”

ð The cost of unsafe injections.
“Unsafe injection practices are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly from hepatitis B and C and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections.”
“Annually more than 1.3 million deaths and US$ 535 million are estimated to be due to current unsafe injection practices. With the global increase in the number of injections for vaccination and medical services, safer injecting technologies such as auto-disable syringes must be budgeted for.”

Deaths Reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, United States, 1997-2013.
“RESULTS: VAERS received 2149 death reports, most (n = 1469 [68.4%]) in children. Median age was 0.5 years (range, 0-100 years); males accounted for 1226 (57%) reports. The total annual number of death reports generally decreased during the latter part of the study period. Most common causes of death among 1244 child reports with available death certificates/autopsy reports included sudden infant death syndrome (n = 544 [44%]), asphyxia (n = 74 [6.0%]), septicemia (n = 61 [4.9%]), and pneumonia (n = 57 [4.6%]). Among 526 adult reports, most common causes of death included diseases of the circulatory (n = 247 [46.9%]) and respiratory systems (n = 77 [14.6%]), certain infections and parasitic diseases (n = 62 [11.8%]), and malignant neoplasms (n = 20 [3.8%]). For child death reports, 79.4% received &gt;1 vaccine on the same day. Inactivated influenza vaccine given alone was most commonly associated with death reports in adults (51.4%).”

The epidemiology of fatalities reported to the vaccine adverse event reporting system 1990-1997.
“RESULTS: A total of 1266 fatalities were reported to VAERS during July 1990 through June 1997. The number of death reports peaked in 1992-1993 and then declined. The overall median age of cases was 0.4 years, with a range of 1 day to 104 years. Nearly half of the deaths were attributed to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).”

[“Euthanasia”-victims and test subjects. The fate of diseased, disabled children in Berlin during World War II].
“This article shows, through a study of the Berlin-Brandenburg region, that children and juveniles who were subjected to the killings of diseased and disabled, or mentally retarded, persons during the Third Reich did not only fall victim to the operations of the “Reichsausschuss” (“Reich Commission for Registration of Severe Disorders in Childhood”). Many were also included in the gas chamber killings of the “T4”-action and in various decentralized killing actions. Furthermore, the co-operation of various medical disciplines in the misuse of children for scientific research is demonstrated by looking into the research on a tuberculosis vaccine. It can be shown that the purpose of the killings was not the painless ending of individual suffering, but that they constituted a means of freeing the public from so-called “ballast existences”, whose lives were only prolonged if they could be of scientific use.”

Fatal adult respiratory distress syndrome in a scalded child after immunization with attenuated virus (measles, mumps and rubella).
“A fatal adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurred in a 15-month-old child who had suffered minor scalding during the febrile response to combined attenuated virus immunization (measles, mumps and rubella [MMR]). Despite vigorous efforts the child died 26 days after the accident. It is suggested that the scalding suppressed the normal immune response to the viremia and that the latter (i.e. most likely the measles viremia) caused the lung damage which, in turn, led to the ARDS.”

ð Fetal tissue research: an ongoing story of professionally responsible success.
“Research using fetal tissue has allowed for development of vaccines for numerous diseases including polio, rubella, and measles.”
“These scientific and medical advances are dependent on the use of fetal tissue from aborted fetuses. While the practice of induced abortion despite societal benefit may be theologically objectionable to some, these practices are professionally responsible. Federal regulations exist to discourage patients from being influenced by the societal benefit of fetal research in arriving at the decision to terminate as well as to prevent researchers from influencing a patientâs decision.”

Fever and multisystem organ failure associated with 17D-204 yellow fever vaccination: a report of four cases.
“In 1998, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was notified of three patients who developed severe illnesses days after yellow fever vaccination. A similar case occurred in 1996. All four patients were more than 63 years old.
METHODS: Vaccine strains of yellow fever virus, isolated from the plasma of two patients and the cerebrospinal fluid of one, were characterised by genomic sequencing. Clinical samples were subjected to neutralisation assays, and an immunohistochemical analysis was done on one sample of liver obtained at biopsy.
FINDINGS: The clinical presentations were characterised by fever, myalgia, headache, and confusion, followed by severe multisystemic illnesses. Three patients died. Vaccine-related variants of yellow fever virus were found in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of one vaccinee. The convalescent serum samples of two vaccinees showed antibody responses of at least 1:10240. Immunohistochemical assay of liver tissue showed yellow fever antigen in the Kuppfer cells of the liver sample.”

Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome after vaccination in United States: data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/Food and Drug Administration Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (1990-2005).
“There were 1000 cases (mean age, 47 years) of GBS reported after vaccination in the United States between 1990 and 2005. The onset of GBS was within 6 weeks in 774 cases, &gt;6 weeks in 101, and unknown in 125. Death and disability after the event occurred in 32 (3.2%) and 167 (16.7%) subjects, respectively. The highest number (n = 632) of GBS cases was observed in subjects receiving influenza vaccine followed by hepatitis B vaccine (n = 94). Other vaccines or combinations of vaccines were associated with 274 cases of GBS. The incidence of GBS after influenza vaccination was marginally higher in subjects or=65 years (P = 0.09); for hepatitis vaccine, the incidence was significantly higher (P 80% of abandoned children, used as repository of cowpox virus, were dying in their first year of life.”

                                Anetoderma occurring after hepatitis B vaccination.
“Anetoderma is an elastolytic disorder of unknown origin. To our knowledge, anetoderma secondary to hepatitis B immunization has been described only once in the literature, in two siblings vaccinated at the same time. We describe, what we believe to be an additional case of such a rare disorder in a 21-year-old man. He presented with white spots and papules on his neck, upper limbs and trunk, that had developed gradually within the last 6 years without any symptoms. The initial lesions were red macules, which gradually enlarged in size and number, becoming pale. Biopsy of a sack-like lesion revealed normal epidermis and a discrete mononuclear infiltrate throughout the dermis. Association of anetoderma with hepatitis B vaccination is speculated here, as suggested by history of vaccination two weeks prior to the onset of skin eruption and ruling out other possible causes of anetoderma.”

Borderline tuberculoid leprosy following BCG vaccination. A case report.
“Borderline tuberculoid leprosy was diagnosed clinically and histologically in a four year-old boy about 6 months after intradermal vaccination with BCG. His mother reported that a lesion began to appear above the vaccination site on the arm 2 weeks after the vaccination, and a second lesion appeared on the chin 2 months later. Responses in the lymphocyte transformation test to sonicated Mycobacterium leprae, BCG, and to PPD were consistent with a tuberculoid leprosy infection. Precipitation of BT leprosy by intradermal BCG infection may possibly represent the overcoming of a phase of primary suppression in an individual who might otherwise have progressed toward lepromatous leprosy. The implications of this hypothesis for the planning of a controlled trial of an anti-leprosy vaccine are discussed.”

[Cancer on a smallpox vaccination scar].
“A 52 year old housewife was vaccinated against smallpox at the age of 18, on her right deltoid area. At the age of 50 she noticed erythema and scaling on the vaccination scar and 2 years later a nodule appear that enlarged during the following 3 months. There was no history nor skin changes suggestive of significant sun exposure. The histological examination of an initial biopsy and of the subsequently excised lesion revealed a basal cell carcinoma of the solid type.”

Characterisation of poxviruses from sporadic human infections.
“An orthopoxvirus was isolated from the vesicular rash of a man in Natal who died in coma and who had not been vaccinated. Analysis of the viral DNA showed that it was a vaccinia virus, more closely related to the virus of South African smallpox vaccine than to other vaccinia viruses.” 
“Minor biological differences between the viruses isolated and the corresponding vaccine strains suggested that some natural transmission of the virus had occurred, but the results of DNA analysis implied that they originated from the use of smallpox vaccine.”

Delayed life-threatening reaction to anthrax vaccine.
“CASE REPORT: We report a delayed and potentially serious life-threatening adverse reaction to anthrax vaccine. A previously healthy 34-year-old male was transported to the emergency department with dyspnea, diaphoresis, pallor, and urticarial wheals on his face, arms, and torso after the administration of the third dose of anthrax vaccine. All symptoms resolved after pharmacological intervention and the patient was discharged. Pharmaco-epidemiological data indicate that 30% of anthrax vaccine recipients experience mild local reactions. With large numbers of military personnel being vaccinated, emergency physicians may encounter more vaccine-related adverse reactions.”

Eczema vaccinatum resulting from the transmission of vaccinia virus from a smallpox vaccinee: an investigation of potential fomites in the home environment.
“On March 3, 2007, a 2-year-old boy was hospitalized with eczema vaccinatum. His two siblings, one with eczema, were subsequently removed from the home. Swabs of household items obtained on March 13th were analyzed for orthopoxvirus DNA signatures with real-time PCR. Virus culture was attempted on positive specimens. Eight of 25 household samples were positive by PCR for orthopoxvirus; of these, three yielded viable vaccinia virus in culture. Both siblings were found to have serologic evidence of orthopoxvirus exposure.”

Exacerbation of pemphigus after influenza vaccination.
“Pemphigus is a rare autoimmune disease characterized by flaccid blisters and erosions on skin and mucous epithelia. A critical event in its pathogenesis is production of antidesmoglein antibodies, which mediate the loss of intercellular adhesion in epithelia, leading to blister formation. Multiple environmental factors (ultraviolet radiation, trauma, drugs, infective agents) have been suggested as possible triggers of pemphigus. Occasionally, the disease has been reported to follow viral and bacterial vaccination. We describe a patient who experienced exacerbation of pemphigus shortly after administration of the influenza vaccination on two separate occasions. We review the literature, suggest possible explanations for a causal relationship, and discuss the administration of vaccination to these patients.”

How Contagious Is Vaccinia?
“A report on vaccine-related deaths in the United States during the 1960s found that 12 of the 68 deaths occurred in unvaccinated persons exposed to recently vaccinated family members or friends, a finding that demonstrates the potential gravity of the problem.” 
“Numerous reports have described the spread of vaccinia virus within families. The majority are in- stances of single transmission, usually from a re- cently vaccinated child to an unvaccinated younger sibling.22-25 However, two or more secondary cas- es have been reported in at least eight reports of family outbreaks published from 1931 to 198126-33 (Table 2). Many of the reports describe severe, some- times fatal eczema vaccinatum in the first family member with secondary disease and substantially milder local inoculation disease in the rest of the family.”

Malignant Tumors as a Late Complication of Vaccination
“Four basal and one squamous cell carcinomas and a single instance of a malignant melanoma arising in vaccination scars have occurred in five southern California patients. Sun exposure on a previously scarred skin was the main etiological factor in the development of the basal and squamous cell tumors. Sun exposure was probably unimportant in the case of the melanoma because of the short time interval between vaccination and the development of the tumor.”

Progressive vaccinia in a military smallpox vaccinee - United States, 2009.
“Progressive vaccinia (PV), previously known as vaccinia necrosum, vaccinia gangrenosum, or disseminated vaccinia, is a rare, often fatal adverse event after vaccination with smallpox vaccine, which is made from live vaccinia virus. During recent vaccination programs potential cases of PV were investigated, but none met standard case definitions. PV has not been confirmed to have occurred in the United States since 1987. On March 2, 2009, a U.S. Navy Hospital contacted the Poxvirus Program at CDC to report a possible case of PV in a male military smallpox vaccinee. The service member had been newly diagnosed with acute mylegenous leukemia M0 (AML M0). During evaluation for a chemotherapy-induced neutropenic fever, he was found to have an expanding and nonhealing painless vaccination site 6.5 weeks after receipt of smallpox vaccine.”

Secondary and Tertiary Transfer of Vaccinia Virus Among U.S. Military Personnel — United States and Worldwide, 2002-2004
“Case 1. In early May 2003, a service member received his primary smallpox vaccination. Approximately 6-8 days after vaccination, he experienced a major reaction (i.e., an event that indicates a successful take; is characterized by a papule, vesicle, ulcer, or crusted lesion, surrounded by an area of induration; and usually results in a scar) (4). The vaccinee reported no substantial pruritus. He slept in the same bed as his wife and kept the vaccination site covered with bandages. After bathing, he reportedly dried the vaccination site with tissue, which he discarded into a trash receptacle. He also used separate towels to dry himself, rolled them so the area that dried his arm was inside, and placed them in a laundry container. His wife handled bed linen, soiled clothing, and towels; she reported that she did not see any obvious drainage on clothing or linen and had no direct contact with the vaccination site.
In mid-May, the wife had vesicular skin lesions on each breast near the areola but continued to breastfeed. Approximately 2 weeks later, she was examined at a local hospital, treated for mastitis, and continued to breastfeed. The same day, the infant had a vesicular lesion on the upper lip, followed by another lesion on the left cheek (5). Three days later, the infant was examined by a pediatrician, when another lesion was noted on her tongue. Because of possible early atopic dermatitis lesions on the infantâs cheeks, contact vaccinia infection with increased risk for eczema vaccinatum was considered. The infant was transferred to a military referral medical center for further evaluation. On examination, the infant had seborrheic dermatitis and no ocular involvement. Skin lesion specimens from the mother and infant tested positive for vaccinia by viral culture and PCR at the Alaska Health Department Laboratory and at Madigan Army Medical Center. Because both patients were stable clinically and the lesions were healing without risk for more serious complications, vaccinia immune globulin was not administered. Neither patient had systemic complications from the infection.
Case 2. In July 2003, a service member who had been vaccinated was wrestling with an unvaccinated service member at a military recreational function when the bandages covering the vaccination site fell off. The unvaccinated service member subsequently wrestled with another unvaccinated service member. Six days later, both unvaccinated service members had lesions on their forearms, neck, and face. Skin lesion specimens from both men tested positive for vaccinia virus by PCR and viral culture at Tripler Army Medical Centerâs microbiology laboratory.”

Transmission of vaccinia virus, possibly through sexual contact, to a woman at high risk for adverse complications.
“Severe adverse events, including eczema vaccinatum (EV), can result after smallpox vaccination. Persons at risk for EV include those with underlying dermatologic conditions, such as atopic dermatitis. We investigated a case of vaccinia infection, possibly acquired during sexual contact with a recently vaccinated military service member, in a female Maryland resident with atopic dermatitis. The U.S. Department of Defenseâs Vaccine Healthcare Centers Network (VHCN) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) worked in conjunction with the patientâs physician and the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH) to confirm the diagnosis, ensure treatment, and prevent further transmission. Specimens collected from the patient were tested at the DHMH laboratories and were positive by real-time polymerase chain reaction for nonvariola orthopoxvirus. Testing at the CDC verified the presence of vaccinia-specific DNA signatures. Continuing spread of the patientâs lesions led to the administration of vaccinia immune globulin and strict infection control measures to prevent tertiary transmission to vulnerable family members, also with atopic dermatitis. VHCN contacted the service member to reinforce vaccination site care and hygiene. This case underscores the importance of prevaccination education for those receiving the smallpox vaccine to protect contacts at risk for developing severe adverse reactions.”

Widespread eczema vaccinatum acquired by contacts. A report of an autopsy case
“A 4-month-old male infant predisposed to allergic dermatitis acquired wide-spread eczema vaccinatum by contacts with a recently vaccinated sibling. He died of acute purulent peritonitis following a perforation of multiple duodenal ulcers. Fluorescence immunocytochemical and electron microscopic studies on the skin lesions revealed the presence of viral antigens and numerous virus particles compatible morphologically with those of the mature form from the same batch of smallpox vaccine given to the sibling. A large number of virus particles in the developmental form were also predominantly scattered in the cytoplasm of cells at the stratum malpighii of the epidermis as well as in neutrophils and macrophages in the skin lesions. The virus isolation from the skin lesions was done by using the HeLa cells and the human embryonic lung fibroblasts. No abnormal laboratory data were noted in immunoglobulins. On the basis of atrophy of the thymus and other lymphatic tissues and an appearance of large pyroninophilic cells in association with blastoid transformation, the authors discussed a possible participation of the disturbance of cellular immunity secondary to the virus infection in the development of the disease.”

DTaP with or after measles vaccination increased in-hospital mortality in Guinea-Bissau.
“RESULT: The case fatality was increased for children who had received DTP with or after measles vaccine compared with children who had received measles vaccine as the most recent vaccine, the ratio being 2.53 (1.37-4.67) and 1.77 (0.92-3.41) in the two periods, respectively.”

Hypotonic and hyporesponsive episodes after diptheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccination.
“Administration of the discontinued diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus vaccine was occasionally associated with a hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode in infants. The whole bacterial cell pertussis component was the likely culprit. For this reason, an acellular pertussis component was developed and incorporated into a new vaccine commonly called diptheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTaP). Administration of DTaP vaccine has been followed by remarkably few hypotonic or hyporesponsive episodes. This report describes one of these unusual events.”

Preparation for global introduction of inactivated poliovirus vaccine: safety evidence from the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, 2000-12.
“Of the 41,792 adverse event reports submitted, 39,568 (95%) were for children younger than 7 years. 38,381 of the reports for children in this age group (97%) were for simultaneous vaccination with IPV and other vaccines (most commonly pneumococcal and acellular pertussis vaccines), whereas standalone IPV vaccines accounted for 0·5% of all reports. 34,880 reports were for non-serious events (88%), 3905 reports were for non-fatal serious events (10%), and 783 reports were death reports (2%). Injection-site erythema was the most commonly coded term for non-serious events (29%), and pyrexia for non-fatal serious events (38%). Most deaths (96%) were in children aged 12 months or younger; most (52%) had sudden infant death syndrome as the reported cause of death.”

🛑 Hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode in a 7-month-old infant after receipt of multiple vaccinations.
“A 7-month-old boy became difficult to arouse, was limp and had blue extremities 8 hours after immunization with intravenous poliovirus, diphtheria-tetanus toxoids-acellular pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae type b-hepatitis B virus and pneumococcal vaccines. The hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode had resolved by the time the infant was seen in an emergency department 1 hour later. The report describes hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode, encourages reporting of vaccine-associated adverse events and discusses prognosis and implications for subsequent immunization.”

Neuropathology of vaccination in infants and children.
“AIMS: Documentation of clinical-pathological features of 37 infants/children whose parents alleged a relationship between vaccination and death or permanent central nervous system (CNS) damage, and sought compensation through the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.
SCOPE: Of the 5545 claims filed during the 10-year period (1990-1999), CNS tissue was available for evaluation by a pediatric neuropathologist in 37; 33 died and 4 had a biopsy or lobectomy. Most commonly implicated vaccines were DTP/DTaP, followed by MMR and IPV/OPV, but almost all of the vaccines currently given to infants/children were alleged to be responsible for the illness/death. No lesions were found in 5 of 37 (13.5%). The most frequent abnormality consisted of acute anoxic encephalopathy (14 of 37 - 37.8%), consequent to several different causes, such as positional asphyxia, cardio-respiratory arrest during status epilepticus, etc. The remaining children manifested other lesions, including inflammation (5 of 37 - 13.5%), vascular and developmental anomalies (4 each of 37 or 10.6%), cerebral edema and system degeneration (2 each of 37 or 5.4%), and one case of heavy metal exposure in a child living near an abandoned mine (2.2%).”

Origins of and solutions for neonatal medication-dispensing errors.
“In 2008, there were five cases in which look-alike or sound-alike neonatal medication-dispensing errors occurred at our institution. A mix-up between neonatal and adult or pediatric products occurred in four of the five cases. Three of the five errors resulted in near misses with the potential to cause harm. The other two errors reached the patients but did not cause harm. The medication mix-ups involved adult and neonatal phytonadione injectable emulsion, sodium citrate injection and vancomycin-heparin combination injection, adult tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis and infant diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccines, Haemophilus B and DTaP vaccines, and cisatracurium and vecuronium.”

Acute fulminant myocarditis after diphtheria, polio, and tetanus vaccination.
“We report an infant case of acute fulminant myocarditis which occurred after administration of a diphtheria, polio, and tetanus vaccination. Fever and dyspnea developed after the vaccination. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was used for intractable cardiogenic shock. The patient survived the extracorporeal support, but poor ventricular contractility recurred 2 months later and she died while waiting for heart transplantation.”

Adverse events following vaccination in premature infants.
“Apparent adverse events were noted in 17 of 45 (37.8%) babies: 9 (20%) had major events, i.e. apnoea, bradycardia or desaturations, and 8 (17.8%) had minor events, i.e. increased oxygen requirements, temperature instability, poor handling and feed intolerance. Babies with major events were significantly younger (p &lt; 0.05), had a lower postmenstrual age (p &lt; 0.05) and weighed less (p &lt; 0.05) at the time of vaccination compared with babies without major events.&quot; 
&quot;CONCLUSION: Vaccine-related cardiorespiratory events are relatively common in preterm babies. Problems were much more common if vaccine is administered at or before 70 d. These babies should therefore be monitored postvaccination.&quot;

Hypotonic-hyporesponsive episodes after administration of hexavalent DTP-based combination vaccine: A description of 12 cases. (2017) 
“Hypotonic-hyporesponsive (HHE) episodes are known and recognized phenomena, which typically occur within 48 hours of immunisation..Our aim is to describe 12 cases of HHE brought to the Center of Pediatric Sleep Medicine, with attention to the clinical features of the episode and their follow-up. Medical charts of infants visited between 2005-2015 were reviewed. Twelve infants showed a HHE using HHE using Brighton Collaboration Criteria. All infants received a Hexavalent diphtheria -tetanus -pertussis acellular component -hepatitis B-,inactivated poliovirus- Haemophilus influenzae type-b conjugate vaccine. Five out of 12 were brought to Emergency Department, where 2 were symptomatic (one was hyporeactive, the other had fever). No infant died during the episode, or the follow-up, nor developed neurological disease after subsequent vaccinations. HHE are confirmed as benign events, even after administration of hexavalent vaccination, devoid of negative neuropsychomotor outcome.”

Incidence of apnoea and bradycardia in preterm infants following triple antigen immunization.
“Ninety-seven preterm infants were immunized with diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) prior to discharge from hospital. The mean gestational age at birth was 28.1 weeks (range 24-34) and the mean age at immunization was 80.6 days (range 44-257). Nineteen (20%) infants developed apnoea or bradycardia within 24 h of immunization. The infants who developed apnoea and/or bradycardia had a younger gestational age at birth than those who did not (P = 0.03), were artificially ventilated for longer (P = 0.01) and were more likely to have a diagnosis of chronic lung disease (P = 0.006). In the majority of infants these events were not clinically significant. Two infants who developed concurrent upper respiratory tract infections required additional oxygen and one of them was treated with oral theophylline. In general, it is safe practice to immunize preterm infants with DTP unless otherwise contraindicated. However, it is recommended that cardiorespiratory function is monitored after immunization in very preterm infants who had prolonged ventilatory support and/or chronic lung disease.”

Neuropathology of vaccination in infants and children.
“AIMS: Documentation of clinical-pathological features of 37 infants/children whose parents alleged a relationship between vaccination and death or permanent central nervous system (CNS) damage, and sought compensation through the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.
SCOPE: Of the 5545 claims filed during the 10-year period (1990-1999), CNS tissue was available for evaluation by a pediatric neuropathologist in 37; 33 died and 4 had a biopsy or lobectomy. Most commonly implicated vaccines were DTP/DTaP, followed by MMR and IPV/OPV, but almost all of the vaccines currently given to infants/children were alleged to be responsible for the illness/death. No lesions were found in 5 of 37 (13.5%). The most frequent abnormality consisted of acute anoxic encephalopathy (14 of 37 - 37.8%), consequent to several different causes, such as positional asphyxia, cardio-respiratory arrest during status epilepticus, etc. The remaining children manifested other lesions, including inflammation (5 of 37 - 13.5%), vascular and developmental anomalies (4 each of 37 or 10.6%), cerebral edema and system degeneration (2 each of 37 or 5.4%), and one case of heavy metal exposure in a child living near an abandoned mine (2.2%).”

Outbreak of pertussis in highly immunized adolescents and its secondary spread to their families.
“An outbreak of pertussis was recognized in a highly immunized sixth-grade class of schoolchildren. Among 43 children aged 11-12 years in the class, 38 had been immunized with three doses or more of DTP containing whole-cell pertussis vaccine, two with two doses of DTP and three children were unimmunized. The last DTP vaccines had been given 6-10 years before the outbreak. A total of eight children with pertussis suffering paroxysmal coughing attacks for 3 weeks or more were identified, seven being fully immunized and one unimmunized. Among the eight cases, two were confirmed by both culture and serology and one by serology alone. The attack rate in fully immunized children was 18.4% (7/38). Secondary spread of pertussis was identified in five of the households from which the eight patients originated. A total of six cases of pertussis from these five households were identified, and two of these were culture-confirmed. These observations suggest that vaccine-induced immunity weakens considerably 6-10 years after vaccination, and that booster immunization with DTP instead of DT is therefore recommended for the control of pertussis.”

Recurrent seizures after diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine immunization. Onset less than 24 hours after vaccination.
“Twenty-two patients with recurrent seizures that started less than 24 hours after immunization with diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP) vaccine were retrospectively studied. The initial seizure generally occurred after one of the first three DTP vaccine immunizations, and followed that immunization by less than 12 hours. Two of the 22 patients were siblings. Eight patients had additional immunizations with DTP vaccine and four had immediate worsening of their seizures. Of the 22 patients, only one was seizure free and stopped taking anticonvulsants. Three patients exhibited normal development, and 11 had severe developmental delays. Based on these observations, we reviewed current contraindications for immunization with pertussis vaccine.”

Revisiting the possibility of serious adverse events from the whole cell pertussis vaccine: were metabolically vulnerable children at risk?
“In the early 1980âs concerns about the safety of the whole cell pertussis vaccine in the United States resulted in declining vaccination rates and the withdrawal of multiple vaccine providers from the market. While the possibility of inflammation and febrile reactions to the vaccine were acknowledged by public health authorities, parents also claimed the vaccine was associated with sudden infant death syndrome and encephalopathy. Epidemiological studies examining this question, however, consistently failed to identify an association. We argue that these reactions may have occurred in metabolically vulnerable children, specifically those with defects in fatty acid oxidation. In these children the combination of anorexia and fever that could be caused by the vaccine may have resulted in hypoglycemic episodes and possibly death. We believe that this association was not detected because these conditions were not recognized at the time and because these conditions are uncommon. Nevertheless, at a population level, enough events could have occurred to cause concern amongst parents.”

Vaccine-related adverse events in Cuban children, 1999-2008.
“The DTwP vaccine exhibited the highest rate of adverse events. Common minor events were: fever (17,538), reactions at injection site (4470) and systemic side effects (2422). Rare events (by WHO definition) reported were: persistent crying (2666), hypotonic-hyporesponsive episodes (3), encephalopathy (2) and febrile seizures (112). Severe events included: anaphylaxis (2), respiratory distress (1), multiple organ failure (1), sudden death (1), vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (2), toxic shock syndrome (3), and sepsis (1). The 10 deaths and 3 cases of disability were investigated by an expert commission, which concluded that 8 of the 13 severe events were vaccination-related.”

                                Eczema vaccinatum resulting from the transmission of vaccinia virus from a smallpox vaccinee: an investigation of potential fomites in the home environment.
“On March 3, 2007, a 2-year-old boy was hospitalized with eczema vaccinatum. His two siblings, one with eczema, were subsequently removed from the home. Swabs of household items obtained on March 13th were analyzed for orthopoxvirus DNA signatures with real-time PCR. Virus culture was attempted on positive specimens. Eight of 25 household samples were positive by PCR for orthopoxvirus; of these, three yielded viable vaccinia virus in culture. Both siblings were found to have serologic evidence of orthopoxvirus exposure.”

How Contagious Is Vaccinia?
“A report on vaccine-related deaths in the United States during the 1960s found that 12 of the 68 deaths occurred in unvaccinated persons exposed to recently vaccinated family members or friends, a finding that demonstrates the potential gravity of the problem.” 
“Numerous reports have described the spread of vaccinia virus within families. The majority are in- stances of single transmission, usually from a re- cently vaccinated child to an unvaccinated younger sibling.22-25 However, two or more secondary cas- es have been reported in at least eight reports of family outbreaks published from 1931 to 198126-33 (Table 2). Many of the reports describe severe, some- times fatal eczema vaccinatum in the first family member with secondary disease and substantially milder local inoculation disease in the rest of the family.”

Severe eczema vaccinatum in a household contact of a smallpox vaccinee.
“A 28-month-old child with refractory atopic dermatitis developed eczema vaccinatum after exposure to his father, a member of the US military who had recently received smallpox vaccine. The father had a history of inactive eczema but reportedly reacted normally to the vaccine. The child’s mother also developed contact vaccinia infection.”

Transmission of vaccinia virus, possibly through sexual contact, to a woman at high risk for adverse complications.
“Severe adverse events, including eczema vaccinatum (EV), can result after smallpox vaccination. Persons at risk for EV include those with underlying dermatologic conditions, such as atopic dermatitis. We investigated a case of vaccinia infection, possibly acquired during sexual contact with a recently vaccinated military service member, in a female Maryland resident with atopic dermatitis. The U.S. Department of Defense’s Vaccine Healthcare Centers Network (VHCN) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) worked in conjunction with the patient’s physician and the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH) to confirm the diagnosis, ensure treatment, and prevent further transmission. Specimens collected from the patient were tested at the DHMH laboratories and were positive by real-time polymerase chain reaction for nonvariola orthopoxvirus. Testing at the CDC verified the presence of vaccinia-specific DNA signatures. Continuing spread of the patient’s lesions led to the administration of vaccinia immune globulin and strict infection control measures to prevent tertiary transmission to vulnerable family members, also with atopic dermatitis. VHCN contacted the service member to reinforce vaccination site care and hygiene. This case underscores the importance of prevaccination education for those receiving the smallpox vaccine to protect contacts at risk for developing severe adverse reactions.”

Widespread eczema vaccinatum acquired by contacts. A report of an autopsy case
“A 4-month-old male infant predisposed to allergic dermatitis acquired wide-spread eczema vaccinatum by contacts with a recently vaccinated sibling. He died of acute purulent peritonitis following a perforation of multiple duodenal ulcers. Fluorescence immunocytochemical and electron microscopic studies on the skin lesions revealed the presence of viral antigens and numerous virus particles compatible morphologically with those of the mature form from the same batch of smallpox vaccine given to the sibling. A large number of virus particles in the developmental form were also predominantly scattered in the cytoplasm of cells at the stratum malpighii of the epidermis as well as in neutrophils and macrophages in the skin lesions. The virus isolation from the skin lesions was done by using the HeLa cells and the human embryonic lung fibroblasts. No abnormal laboratory data were noted in immunoglobulins. On the basis of atrophy of the thymus and other lymphatic tissues and an appearance of large pyroninophilic cells in association with blastoid transformation, the authors discussed a possible participation of the disturbance of cellular immunity secondary to the virus infection in the development of the disease.”

                                ANTIRABIES ANTIBODY RESPONSE IN MAN TO VACCINE MADE FROM INFECTED SUCKLING-MOUSE BRAINS.
“Antirabies vaccines produced from infected brains of adult mammals have always had the potentiality of causing post-vaccinal paralysis or allergic encephalitis in man. Attempts in recent years either to remove the paralytic factor from brain-tissue vaccines or to use as the virus source infected tissue other than nervous tissue (e.g., chick embryos) have usually resulted in a substantial reduction of the specific antirabies potency.”

Deep sequencing reveals persistence of cell-associated mumps vaccine virus in chronic encephalitis.
“Notwithstanding this, we describe here devastating neurological complications associated with the detection of live-attenuated mumps virus Jeryl Lynn (MuV(JL5)) in the brain of a child who had undergone successful allogeneic transplantation for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). This is the first confirmed report of MuV(JL5) associated with chronic encephalitis and highlights the need to exclude immunodeficient individuals from immunisation with live-attenuated vaccines.”

Encephalitis related to a H1N1 vaccination: case report and review of the literature.
“RESULTS: We report a case of a 26-year-old female who developed symptoms of acute encephalitis 5 days after vaccination against the pandemic 2009 A/H1N1 influenza. MRI of the brain showed confluent T2-hyperintense signal intensity changes in the deep white matter which further confirmed the diagnosis of encephalitis/acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Despite therapy with immunoglobulins and corticosteroids, her persistent vegetative state continued. In light of the dramatic cause of this case, we reviewed all 21 other previously reported cases of central nervous system demyelination related to H1N1 vaccination and/or infection.
CONCLUSIONS: The available data suggest that even severe central nervous system demyelination i.e. acute encephalitis/disseminated encephalomyelitis and transverse myelitis may very rarely be associated with vaccination against novel influenza A/H1N1 or with A/H1N1 infection itself.”

[Recurrent encephalitis following annual influenza vaccine. Case report].
“Influenza vaccine is rarely associated with neurological adverse effects such as Guillain Barré syndrome, encephalitis or aseptic meningitis. We report the case of a male patient that presented two episodes of acute encephalitis in consecutive years, 16 and 20 days after his annual influenza vaccine shot, respectively. In both instances, patient required ICU admission and evolved with fast recovery and no sequels. The first episode was managed empirically as herpetic encephalitis but an extensive study was performed in the second episode without identifying any microorganism. Neuroimaging studies also discarded acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Mild pleocytosis of mononuclear predominance was detected in both cases in CSF. Naranjo score punctuated 8 points indicating a probable causal relationship. Acute encephalitis is a rare adverse effect of influenza vaccine and occurs several days after immunization. It has a broad differential diagnosis, and appears to be of self-limited duration and associated with good prognosis.”

Vaccine-associated contact paralytic poliomyelitis with atypical neurological presentation.
“Paralytic poliomyelitis presenting with quadriparesis, transient encephalitis and bulbar symptoms in 2 patients in close contact with recently vaccinated children with trivalent live oral polio vaccine is described. Symmetrical lower motor neuron involvement of deltoid muscles with electromyographic confirmation was found. Upper motor neuron signs, with symmetrical hyperactive deep tendon reflexes developed in the lower extremities. Poliovirus Type-2 vaccine-like strain was cultured from one patient and both patients showed significant antibody titers rises to poliovirus. Attention is drawn to the possible clinical differences between vaccine associated poliomelitis and the usual features found in wild strain poliomyelitis. It is suggested that in selected cases, non-immunized contacts be given inactivated polio-vaccine when the vaccinees are immunized with the live oral-vaccine.”

Vaccinia virus in postvaccinal encephalitis.
“Results of virological examination of 239 samples taken from 84 children with neurological complications after smallpox vaccination are described. In postvaccinal encephalitis, vaccinia virus was isolated from blood, cerebrospinal fluid and pharyngeal secretions of 23 out of 40 children (57.5%) as well as from autopsy specimens sampled between 10-35 days after vaccination. During the acute period of disease, virus was detected in 17 out of 31 (54.2%) cerebrospinal fluid specimens. In 3 postvaccinal encephalitis cases the virus was present in brain and in a case of encephalomyelitis-in the spinal cord. These results confirmed the participation of vaccinia virus in the pathogenesis of postvaccinal encephalitis. The pathogenicity of vaccinia virus may be manifested only under a changed reactivity of the vaccinated host.”

Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis associated with oral polio vaccine.
“A 27-year-old woman presented with acute paresis after taking an oral polio vaccine (OPV). Deep tendon reflexes were preserved, needle electromyography showed no neurogenic changes, and there were no lesions on spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), suggesting that motor neurons of the spinal cord were not affected. Brain MRI showed abnormal lesions in the tegmentum of the upper pons, left cerebral peduncles, truncus of the corpus callosum, and right parietal lobe. Cerebrospinal fluid revealed mild pleocytosis. The most probable diagnosis was acute disseminated encephalomyelitis associated with OPV.”

ð Demyelinating disease and polyvalent human papilloma virus vaccination
“Since its inception, the polyvalent vaccine against the human papilloma virus (HPV), Gardasil, has generated some controversies as a temporal relationship between the administrations of the vaccine and the development of a few autoimmune diseases, such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), multiple sclerosis (MS) and GuillainâBarre syndrome have been reported.1â3 We encountered two cases whose initial presentation of CNS demyelination followed in close time relationship the administration of Gardasil vaccine and we discuss their possible association.
Case No 1
A 19-year-old woman received two doses of Gardasil, 3 months apart, and approximately 1 month after the second dose, she developed numbness to the right foot that within 1 day extended to the contralateral foot and was associated with mid-thoracic back pain. Her neurological examination was only significant for the altered perception to touch to the feet. Deep tendon reflexes were normal and plantar reflexes in flexion. MRI of cervical and thoracic spine revealed a total of three lesions with characteristic demyelinating appearance, one of those in the thoracic spine was contrast-enhancing (figure 1AâC). MRI brain demonstrated one additional white matter lesion also consistent with a demyelinating process.”

Two Cases of Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis Following Vaccination Against Human Papilloma Virus.
“We herein present two cases of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) following vaccination against human papilloma virus (HPV). Case 1 experienced diplopia and developed an unstable gait 14 days after a second vaccination of Cervarix. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an isolated small, demyelinating lesion in the pontine tegmentum. Case 2 experienced a fever and limb dysesthesia 16 days after a second vaccination of Gardasil. Brain MRI revealed hyperintense lesion in the pons with slight edema on a T2-weighted image. Both cases resolved completely. It is important to accumulate further data on confirmed cases of ADEM temporally associated with HPV vaccination.”

ð [Complications of pertussis immunization (author transl)].
“16 cases of neurological disease and/or death shortly after pertussis immunization are reported. Eight patients had convulsions, six with ensuing permanent defects. Severe polymyositis was observed in one case. Five infants died 12 h to 4 days after vaccination: two after acute encephalopathy and three in the form of a sudden unexpected death (SID). In two fatal cases the morphological changes in the brain corresponded to those of pertussis encephalopathy: neuronal degeneration in various parts of the cortex, especially in the region of the ammons horn, and in the cerebellum. There were no signs of inflammation. Three cases underwent forensic autopsy and death was attributed to bronchopulmonary infection. Complete neuropathological work-up was only done in one case, in which the brain was normal. The critique of episodical reports and the demand for prospective studies is appreciated. Knowledge of all possible forms of complications, however, is indispensable for future investigations. Polymyositis and SID have so far not been listed as abnormal reactions to immunization. The majority of our cases became known accidentally from hospital sheets or from discussions with collegues. For a detection of all possible cases a greater awareness of doctors for the problem of pertussis immunization appears necessary. Only another 23 cases have been reported to the health authorities of the state of Lower Saxony during the last 6 to 7 years. Of those, nine were either harmless reactions or diseases probably unrelated to vaccination. Two were cases of SID, 12 and 72 h after vaccination. It is concluded that only a minor proportion of possible complications is presently reported to the health authorities.”

[Neurologic manifestations following pertussis vaccination].
“Twenty cases of acute neurological complications occuring within 7 days of pertussis immunization are reported. Convulsions were present in every case and status epilepticus was observed in five infants. In only 4 cases were neurological or epileptic sequelae lacking. The clustering of neurological complications in the 24 hours following immunization is not consistent with the hypothesis of a mere temporal coincidence. However, the mechanism and incidence of post-immunization encephalopathies remains obscure and epidemiological studies are in order.”

Revisiting the possibility of serious adverse events from the whole cell pertussis vaccine: were metabolically vulnerable children at risk?
“In the early 1980âs concerns about the safety of the whole cell pertussis vaccine in the United States resulted in declining vaccination rates and the withdrawal of multiple vaccine providers from the market. While the possibility of inflammation and febrile reactions to the vaccine were acknowledged by public health authorities, parents also claimed the vaccine was associated with sudden infant death syndrome and encephalopathy. Epidemiological studies examining this question, however, consistently failed to identify an association. We argue that these reactions may have occurred in metabolically vulnerable children, specifically those with defects in fatty acid oxidation. In these children the combination of anorexia and fever that could be caused by the vaccine may have resulted in hypoglycemic episodes and possibly death. We believe that this association was not detected because these conditions were not recognized at the time and because these conditions are uncommon. Nevertheless, at a population level, enough events could have occurred to cause concern amongst parents.”

Simian cytomegalovirus-related stealth virus isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of a patient with bipolar psychosis and acute encephalopathy.
“A cytopathic ‘stealthâ virus was cultured from the cerebrospinal fluid of a patient with a bipolar psychotic disorder who developed a severe encephalopathy leading to a vegetative state. DNA sequencing of a polymerase chain reaction-amplified product from infected cultures has identified the virus as an African green monkey simian cytomegalovirus (SCMV)-related stealth virus. The virus is similar to the SCMV-related stealth virus isolated from a patient with chronic fatigue syndrome. The findings support the concepts that stealth viruses can account for a spectrum of dysfunctional brain diseases and that some of these viruses may have arisen from live polio viral vaccines.”

Vaccine-related adverse events in Cuban children, 1999-2008.
“The DTwP vaccine exhibited the highest rate of adverse events. Common minor events were: fever (17,538), reactions at injection site (4470) and systemic side effects (2422). Rare events (by WHO definition) reported were: persistent crying (2666), hypotonic-hyporesponsive episodes (3), encephalopathy (2) and febrile seizures (112). Severe events included: anaphylaxis (2), respiratory distress (1), multiple organ failure (1), sudden death (1), vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (2), toxic shock syndrome (3), and sepsis (1). The 10 deaths and 3 cases of disability were investigated by an expert commission, which concluded that 8 of the 13 severe events were vaccination-related.”

                                ð Adverse effect versus quality control of the Fuenzalida-Palacios antirabies vaccine.
“We evaluated the components of the Fuenzalida-Palacios antirabies vaccine, which is till used in most developing countries in human immunization for treatment and prophylaxis. This vaccine is prepared from newborn mouse brains at 1% concentration. Even though the vaccine is considered to have a low myelin content, it is not fully free of myelin or of other undesirable components that might trigger adverse effects after vaccination. The most severe effect is a post-vaccination neuroparalytic accident associated with Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome. In the present study we demonstrate how the vaccines produced and distributed by different laboratories show different component patterns with different degrees of impurity and with varying protein concentrations, indicating that production processes can vary from one laboratory to another. These differences, which could be resolved using a better quality control process, may affect and impair immunization, with consequent risks and adverse effects after vaccination. We used crossed immunoelectrophoresis to evaluate and demonstrate the possibility of quality control in vaccine production, reducing the risk factors possibly involved in these immunizing products.”

ð Assessment of iatrogenic transmission of HCV in Southern Italy: was the cause the Salk polio vaccination?
“Since the first studies on hepatitis C virus (HCV) prevalence were published, it has been evident that southern Italy is an area of hyperendemicity. A recent study conducted in southern Italy suggested that the high prevalence of HCV infection might be the result of past iatrogenic transmission. Polio vaccination with the parenteral Salk vaccine between 1956 and 1965 by multiple use of unsafe glass syringes may have been one of the major causes of the spread of HCV infection among southern Italian adults who are now older than 40 years of age. Persons born between the 1940s and early 1960s have a nearly 3-fold increased risk of HCV seropositivity than the younger age group. The findings are consistent with a cohort effect of exposure to the Salk parenteral vaccination.”

Beware of ‘lookalikesâ. (2017)
“In 2014, health staff who were vaccinating children in rebel-held northern Syria accidentally administered a muscle relaxant, atracurium, to up to 75 children, killing 15 of them. An investigation found that the drug was given to the children instead of a solution used to mix measles vaccines because the packaging was similar.”

Confusing drug packaging contributes to death of 15 children.
“At least 15 children have died after being vaccinated against measles in northern Syria, owing to accidental injection of atracurium.1 The seriousness of this particular event is compounded by the fact that the deaths were associated with vaccination in a population in the midst of civil war whose trust in western medicine is already fragile.”

“Unsafe injection practices are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly from hepatitis B and C and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections.”
“Annually more than 1.3 million deaths and US$ 535 million are estimated to be due to current unsafe injection practices. With the global increase in the number of injections for vaccination and medical services, safer injecting technologies such as auto-disable syringes must be budgeted for.”

ð (Shaken baby syndrome and vaccines)  
Elevated blood histamine caused by vaccinations and Vitamin C deficiency may mimic the shaken baby syndrome.
“The findings of subdural hematoma and retinal hemorrhages in infants, without any documented history of major trauma, do not always indicate child abuse. A combination of ascorbate depletion and the injection of foreign proteins can cause a very high blood histamine level, leading to capillary fragility and venular bleeding. This can be prevented by the administration of vitamin C.”

ð (Shaken baby syndrome and vaccines) 
The evidence base for shaken baby syndrome
“There is every reason to believe that infant deaths following
vaccinations could be prevented or markedly reduced by the administration
of vitamin C before inoculations, instead of the more usual paracetamol
(4, 5). Not only will there be a decrease in the infant death rate; but
also an important reduction in the incidence of cerebral palsy, epilepsy,
cognitive and behavioural problems, and intellectual impairment, can be
expected.”

Fetal damage after accidental polio vaccination of an immune mother.
“Irreparable damage to the anterior horn cells of the cervical and thoracic cord was found in a 20-week-old fetus whose mother was immune to poliomyelitis before conceiving but who was inadvertently given oral polio vaccine at 18 weeks gestation. Polio neutralizing antibody titres in sera, taken before and after pregnancy, were identical and were at levels normally regarded as providing protection. Unsuccessful attempts were made to isolate poliovirus from extracts of fetal brain, lung, liver and placenta. Fluorescent antibody tests were performed on various levels of the central nervous system and on the left and right extensor forearm muscles. Specific positive fluorescence to poliovirus 2 and 3 antigens was detected at dorsal spinal cord level only. One positive result was seen with Coxsackie A9 antiserum and fresh guinea-pig complement in the inflammatory cells in the right extensor forearm muscles.This experience, as yet unexplained, underlines the importance of ensuring that women are not pregnant prior to oral polio vaccination.”

The injection century: massive unsterile injections and the emergence of human pathogens.
“Unsterile medical injections are common in the less-developed world, where most visits to a doctor result in the (generally unnecessary) administration of intramuscular, or subcutaneous drugs. WHO estimates1 that every year unsafe injections result in 80 000â160 000 new HIV-1 infections, 8Â·16 million hepatitis B infections, and 2Â·3â4Â·7 million hepatitis C infections worldwide (this figure does not include transfusions). Together, these illnesses account for 1Â·3 million deaths and 23 million years of lost life.”

Morbidity and mortality from medical errors: an increasingly serious public health problem.
“From 1983 to 1998, U.S. fatalities from acknowledged prescription errors increased by 243%, from 2,876 to 9,856. This percentage increase was greater than for almost any other cause of death, and far outpaced the increase in the number of prescriptions. Many nonfatal prescription errors also occur, but estimates of the frequency of these errors vary widely, because various definitions, geographic settings, and institutions have been used.”

Origins of and solutions for neonatal medication-dispensing errors.
“In 2008, there were five cases in which look-alike or sound-alike neonatal medication-dispensing errors occurred at our institution. A mix-up between neonatal and adult or pediatric products occurred in four of the five cases. Three of the five errors resulted in near misses with the potential to cause harm. The other two errors reached the patients but did not cause harm. The medication mix-ups involved adult and neonatal phytonadione injectable emulsion, sodium citrate injection and vancomycin-heparin combination injection, adult tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis and infant diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccines, Haemophilus B and DTaP vaccines, and cisatracurium and vecuronium.”

Our prescription drugs kill us in large numbers.
“Our prescription drugs are the third leading cause of death after heart disease and cancer in the United States and Europe. Around half of those who die have taken their drugs correctly; the other half die because of errors, such as too high a dose or use of a drug despite contraindications. Our drug agencies are not particularly helpful, as they rely on fake fixes, which are a long list of warnings, precautions, and contraindications for each drug, although they know that no doctor can possibly master all of these. Major reasons for the many drug deaths are impotent drug regulation, widespread crime that includes corruption of the scientific evidence about drugs and bribery of doctors, and lies in drug marketing, which is as harmful as tobacco marketing and, therefore, should be banned. We should take far fewer drugs, and patients should carefully study the package inserts of the drugs their doctors prescribe for them and independent information sources about drugs such as Cochrane reviews, which will make it easier for them to say “no thanks”.”

“In March, 2016, a vaccine scandal in Shandong province, eastern China, has led to the deaths of four children. According to state media, the prime culprit, a former pharmacist, was caught delivering vaccines to medical facilities on bicycles without approved storage conditions. The Shandong Food and Drug Administration made public a list of 25 problematic vaccines-including polio, mumps, rabies, hepatitis B, encephalitis, and meningococcal vaccinesâthat had been illegally sold in at least 24 provincial areas since 2011. Those vaccines are worth more than Â¥570 million (ie, US$88 million).”

Your Health Care May Kill You: Medical Errors. 2017. 
“Recent studies of medical errors have estimated errors may account for as many as 251,000 deaths annually in the United States (U.S)., making medical errors the third leading cause of death. Error rates are significantly higher in the U.S. than in other developed countries such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Germany and the United Kingdom (U.K). At the same time less than 10 percent of medical errors are reported.”
“The results suggest that improving patient safety requires more than voluntary reporting. Organizational changes need to be implemented and institutionalized as well.”

ð Adverse events associated with childhood vaccines other than pertussis and rubella. Summary of a report from the Institute of Medicine.
The committee found that the evidence favored acceptance of a causal relation between diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome and brachial neuritis, between measles vaccine and anaphylaxis, between oral polio vaccine and Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome, and between unconjugated Hib vaccine and susceptibility to Hib disease. The committee found that the evidence established causality between diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and anaphylaxis, between measles vaccine and death from measles vaccine-strain viral infection, between measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and thrombocytopenia and anaphylaxis, between oral polio vaccine and poliomyelitis and death from polio vaccine-strain viral infection, and between hepatitis B vaccine and anaphylaxis.

Characteristics of poliovirus strains from long-term excretors with primary immunodeficiencies.
“Individuals who are deficient in humoral immunity are particularly at risk from infection with enteroviruses, and poliovirus in particular, where antibodies are the main source of protection from disease. Long-term excretion of vaccine strains of poliovirus has been documented for many years and instances of paralytic poliomyelitis in hypogammaglobulinaemic patients who were subsequently found to have been excreting virus for prolonged periods have been reported in the U.S.A., Germany and Japan. The identification of a healthy immunodeficient patient in the U.K. who has probably been excreting type 2 poliovirus for 15 years will be described, with the characteristics of the virus and the results of attempts at treatment so far. Such individuals pose a significant risk to the eradication programme unless they can be identified and treated.”

ð Estimating the extent of vaccine-derived poliovirus infection.
“Eight outbreaks of paralytic polio attributable to circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) have highlighted the risks associated with oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) use in areas of low vaccination coverage and poor hygiene.” 
“Although only 114 virologically-confirmed paralytic cases were identified in the eight cVDPV outbreaks, it is likely that a minimum of hundreds of thousands, and more likely several million individuals were infected during these events, and that many thousands more have been infected by VDPV lineages within outbreaks which have escaped detection.”

Explosive school-based measles outbreak: intense exposure may have resulted in high risk, even among revaccinees.
“Even high levels of measles vaccination coverage have not always prevented outbreaks of measles spread by airborne transmission. It has been suggested that a large inoculum might increase vaccine failure risk. Airbome transmission might occasionally entail a large measles inoculum. The epidemiologic relevance of measles among properly vaccinated persons (i.e., those vaccinated after 15 months of age and with live attenuated virus) is increased when they become contagious. The authors studied inoculum intensities as measured by proxy variables and the contagiousness of properly vaccinated persons who contracted measles among 51 measles patients infected in one school, at home, or elsewhere, utilizing preexisting records of measles cases and 214 healthy controls from an explosive school outbreak that occurred in a rural Finnish municipality in 1989. One “super-spreader” infected 22 others in one day, including eight once-vaccinated students and one twice-vaccinated student, probably during an assembly of 144 students in a poorly ventilated hallway with no sunlight. Those infected later at home had high measles risk, even if they were revaccinees. When siblings shared a bedroom with a measles case, a 78 percent risk (seven out of nine children) was observed among vaccinees. Vaccinees had approximately 2 daysâ shorter incubation time than unvaccinated persons. Vaccinated and unvaccinated students were equally able to infect their siblings. Total protection against measles might not be achievable, even among revaccinees, when children are confronted with intense exposure to measles virus.”

Fever and multisystem organ failure associated with 17D-204 yellow fever vaccination: a report of four cases.
“In 1998, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was notified of three patients who developed severe illnesses days after yellow fever vaccination. A similar case occurred in 1996. All four patients were more than 63 years old.
METHODS: Vaccine strains of yellow fever virus, isolated from the plasma of two patients and the cerebrospinal fluid of one, were characterised by genomic sequencing. Clinical samples were subjected to neutralisation assays, and an immunohistochemical analysis was done on one sample of liver obtained at biopsy.
FINDINGS: The clinical presentations were characterised by fever, myalgia, headache, and confusion, followed by severe multisystemic illnesses. Three patients died. Vaccine-related variants of yellow fever virus were found in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of one vaccinee. The convalescent serum samples of two vaccinees showed antibody responses of at least 1:10240. Immunohistochemical assay of liver tissue showed yellow fever antigen in the Kuppfer cells of the liver sample.”

Intensive epidemiologic, virological, and serological evaluations were launched, which eventually found no evidence for the transmission of AIDS to recipients of the plasma-derived HBsAg vaccine.”

A large vaccine-derived poliovirus outbreak on Madura Island-Indonesia, 2005.
“Between June and October 2005, 45 laboratory-confirmed type 1 vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) cases were identified on Madura Island in Indonesia. Genetic sequencing data on VDPV isolates were consistent with replication and circulation for up to approximately 2 years. Concurrent circulation with type 1 wild poliovirus (WPV) enabled comparisons of VDPV and WPV cases and found that clinical and epidemiological features of both were similar. Attack rates for VDPV were as high as those for WPV. Of 41 VDPV case patients with known vaccination status, 25 (61%) had received zero oral polio vaccine (OPV) doses.”

ð LESSONS FROM THE SALK POLIO VACCINE: METHODS FOR AND RISKS OF RAPID TRANSLATION
“Regretfully, the story of polio vaccine was not without tragedy. In April 1955, soon after mass polio vaccination began in the United States, reports trickled in to the Surgeon General concerning atypical cases of paralytic polio. Several paralytic polio cases were reported in California in patients who had received the polio vaccine about a week earlier but the paralysis only affected the arm or leg in which they received the injection. Each of these cases occurred in polio vaccine produced by Cutter pharmaceutical company. The Surgeon General immediately pulled all Cutter polio vaccine, but it was too late; nearly 400,000 children had been inoculated with Cutter polio vaccine and 250 cases of atypical paralytic polio occurred. There were also reports of the Wyeth pharmaceutical company polio vaccine causing paralysis and death in several children in the northeastern United States.
It was soon discovered that some lots of Cutter and Wyeth polio vaccine were insufficiently inactivated with formalin leading to live polio virus in more than 100,000 doses. In fact, 16 lots of Cutter polio vaccine were retested and the first 6 lots produced were positive for live polio virus. These incidents demonstrated the lack of oversight and safeguards put into place before the vaccine was made so widely available.”

Live attenuated varicella vaccine: evidence that the virus is attenuated and the importance of skin lesions in transmission of varicella-zoster virus. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Varicella Vaccine Collaborative Study Group.
“To examine whether the live varicella vaccine virus is attenuated, we analyzed varicella vaccine-induced contact cases of clinical chickenpox in healthy siblings of immunized children with leukemia. A rash developed approximately 1 month later in 156 children with leukemia who had been vaccinated. Vaccine-type virus was isolated from 25 of these children. Of 88 known susceptible healthy siblings who were exposed to a vaccine with a rash and from whom follow-up information was available, there was evidence of infection in 15 (17%). Of 15 siblings with seroconversion, 11 (73%) also acquired a mild rash with an average of 38 lesions and no accompanying systemic symptoms. Vaccine-type virus was isolated from four of the contact siblings. Tertiary transmission was documented once. Contact siblings with seroconversion were protected during future household exposure to chickenpox, which occurred in four instances.”

Measles outbreak in a vaccinated population in Dhankutta.
“A measles outbreak occurred in Dhankutta town in year 2056 Falgun to 2057 Baishak (3 months). A total of 130 cases were registered at the Dhankutta District Hospital. A large proportion of the cases had severe disease with complications and were admitted at the hospital. None of the patients registered at the hospital died. Interestingly, 50.0% of cases were in higher age group (10 years and above) which is an unusual trend in developing countries. All the cases gave history of measles vaccination, which points towards the need for investigation of vaccine efficacy and cold chain efficiency.”

“We report a Brazilian infant who developed VAPP 40 days after receiving the first dose of oral polio vaccine (OPV). MR images of the cervical and thoracic spinal cord showed lesions involving the anterior horn cell, with increased signal intensity on T2-weighted sequences. We would like to emphasize the importance of considering VAPP as a differential diagnosis in patients with acute flaccid paralysis and an MRI showing involvement of medulla oblongata or spinal cord, particularly in countries where OPV is extensively administered.”

Outbreak of pertussis in highly immunized adolescents and its secondary spread to their families.
“An outbreak of pertussis was recognized in a highly immunized sixth-grade class of schoolchildren. Among 43 children aged 11-12 years in the class, 38 had been immunized with three doses or more of DTP containing whole-cell pertussis vaccine, two with two doses of DTP and three children were unimmunized. The last DTP vaccines had been given 6-10 years before the outbreak. A total of eight children with pertussis suffering paroxysmal coughing attacks for 3 weeks or more were identified, seven being fully immunized and one unimmunized. Among the eight cases, two were confirmed by both culture and serology and one by serology alone. The attack rate in fully immunized children was 18.4% (7/38). Secondary spread of pertussis was identified in five of the households from which the eight patients originated. A total of six cases of pertussis from these five households were identified, and two of these were culture-confirmed. These observations suggest that vaccine-induced immunity weakens considerably 6-10 years after vaccination, and that booster immunization with DTP instead of DT is therefore recommended for the control of pertussis.”

Outbreak of poliomyelitis in Hispaniola associated with circulating type 1 vaccine-derived poliovirus.
“An outbreak of paralytic poliomyelitis occurred in the Dominican Republic (13 confirmed cases) and Haiti (8 confirmed cases, including 2 fatal cases) during 2000-2001. All but one of the patients were either unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated children, and cases occurred in communities with very low (7 to 40%) rates of coverage with oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV). The outbreak was associated with the circulation of a derivative of the type 1 OPV strain, probably originating from a single OPV dose given in 1998-1999. The vaccine-derived poliovirus associated with the outbreak had biological properties indistinguishable from those of wild poliovirus.”

Poliovirus Infections in Four Unvaccinated Children — Minnesota, August-October 2005
“On September 29, 2005, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) identified poliovirus type 1 in an unvaccinated, immunocompromised infant girl aged 7 months (the index patient) in an Amish community whose members predominantly were unvaccinated for polio. The patient has no paralysis; the source of the patientâs infection is unknown. Subsequently, poliovirus infections in three other children within the index patientâs community have been documented.”
“Partial sequencing of the virus capsid protein coding region (VP1) of the poliovirus genome at the MDH laboratory identified it as a vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV). VDPVs are poliovirus strains derived from one of the three Sabin poliovirus strains in oral polio vaccine (OPV) that have &gt;1% difference in nucleotide sequence from the prototype vaccine virus.”

For the serious AEs, the outcome was favorable in 88% of cases and none of the 12 reported deaths were attributed to a side effect of vaccination. Fifty-nine cases of pneumococcal disease that suggest an ineffective vaccine were reported, but only 16 can be considered as a real failure of the vaccination.”

A prefecture-wide survey of mumps meningitis associated with measles, mumps and rubella vaccine.
“A survey of untoward reactions, especially central nervous system reactions, after the administration of a newly introduced measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine in Gunma Prefecture, Japan, was initiated soon after 4 patients were hospitalized for aseptic meningitis. Thirty-five, 6 and 2 children developed meningitis, convulsive disorders and parotitis, respectively, within 2 months after MMR vaccination during the 8-month period extending from April to November, 1989. The time lag between MMR vaccination and meningitis ranged from 14 to 28 days in the 35 cases of meningitis. Mumps virus, isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid in 13 patients with aseptic meningitis, was characterized by determination of the nucleotide sequences of the P gene as mumps vaccine strain. The incidence of aseptic meningitis with positive mumps vaccine virus was estimated to be 0.11% (0.3% as a whole) during the 8 months from April to November and increased to 0.3% (0.7% as a whole) in September and October. We conclude that the incidence of aseptic meningitis after MMR vaccination seems to be higher than that reported previously.”

Questions regarding the safety and duration of immunity following live yellow fever vaccination.
“We found that antiviral immunity may be lost in 1-in-3 to 1-in-5 individuals within 5 to 10 years after a single vaccination and that children may be at greater risk for primary vaccine failure. The safety profile of YFV-17D was compared to other licensed vaccines including oral polio vaccine (OPV) and the rotavirus vaccine, RotaShield, which have subsequently been withdrawn from the US and world market, respectively. Expert commentary: Based on these results and recent epidemiological data on vaccine failures (particularly evident at &gt;10 years after vaccination), we believe that current recommendations to no longer administer YFV-17D booster vaccination be carefully re-evaluated, and that further development of safer vaccine approaches should be considered.”

Risk factors for measles vaccine failure among immunized students.
“An outbreak of measles occurred in a municipal school system which had reported 98% of students immunized against measles. A case-control study was conducted to determine reasons for vaccine failure. Vaccine failure was associated with immunizations that could not be documented in the providerâs records. Among children with provider-documented immunization, vaccine failure was associated with vaccination at 12 to 14 months of age with an odds ratio of 4.73. Among children vaccinated at 15 months or older, vaccine failure was not associated with time elapsed since vaccination. Studies should be conducted to determine whether unreliable immunization records are a more widespread problem. Further consideration should be given to routine revaccination of children previously vaccinated at 12 to 14 months of age.”

Risks of reintroduction of polio after eradication: the vaccine origin of an outbreak of type 3 poliomyelitis.
“Sabin live-attenuated strains, which have proved to be the most effective tools for poliovirus eradication, could also be the source of reintroduction of polio epidemics after global eradication of wild poliomyelitis is achieved. There are still considerable gaps in our knowledge about the persistence of vaccine-derived viruses in the population and the mechanisms involved in poliovirus transmissibility, both of which are essential factors in assessing the risks posed by such strains and in designing effective strategies for the cessation of polio immunisation. In this report, we have examined virological and epidemiological aspects of an epidemic of poliomyelitis in 1968 in Poland that was shown to be associated with the use of the USOL-D-bac live-attenuated vaccine strain. Possible causes of the origin and progress of the outbreak included the pattern of virus excretion from vaccinees, mutations identified in epidemic viruses and the unique vaccination policies in Poland during the years preceding the epidemic.”

Some ethical issues arising from polio eradication programmes in India.
“The issue of risks and benefits arises in relation to the choice between two different vaccine types available for polio programmes: oral polio vaccine (OPV) and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). OPV is the vaccine currently used in the eradication campaign in India. We argue that given the current risks/benefits profile of this vaccine, there is an urgent need to review the programme and take remedial action to address existing problems (at least in India). The second issue we discuss is the fact that there is little effort to gain the informed consent of the parents of vaccinated children, as they are not currently told about the potential limitations of OPV or the possibility of vaccine-induced harm.”

Use of a novel real-time PCR assay to detect oral polio vaccine shedding and reversion in stool and sewage samples after a mexican national immunization day.
“During replication, oral polio vaccine (OPV) can revert to neurovirulence and cause paralytic poliomyelitis. In individual vaccinees, it can acquire specific revertant point mutations, leading to vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP). With longer replication, OPV can mutate into vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV), which causes poliomyelitis outbreaks similar to those caused by wild poliovirus. After wild poliovirus eradication, safely phasing out vaccination will likely require global use of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) until cessation of OPV circulation.”

Vaccine Failures in Patients Properly Vaccinated with 13-Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine in Catalonia, a Region with Low Vaccination Coverage.
“Vaccine failures occurring with 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in 3 pediatric hospitals in Barcelona (2012-2013) are described. PCV13 vaccine failure was defined as the occurrence of an invasive pneumococcal infection in children properly vaccinated by PCV13. Among 84 patients with invasive pneumococcal infection, 32 had received at least one dose of PCV13. Seventeen of them had invasive pneumococcal infection produced by a PCV13 serotype. Among those, 9 patients were considered to have a PCV13 vaccine failure. Serotype 3 was isolated in 6 patients, serotype 19A in 2 and serotype 6B in 1.”

Vaccine-induced polioencephalomyelitis in Scotland.
“A six-month-old British female, living in Glasgow was admitted in June 1986 with a four-day history of fever and lower limb weakness following immunisation with oral polio and triple (DTP) vaccines. Examination revealed paralysis of all limbs, facial muscles and right diaphragm, scoliosis, opsoclonus and ocular flutter. Poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3, isolated from her stool specimens were all vaccine-like strains.”

Vaccine-related adverse events in Cuban children, 1999-2008.
“The DTwP vaccine exhibited the highest rate of adverse events. Common minor events were: fever (17,538), reactions at injection site (4470) and systemic side effects (2422). Rare events (by WHO definition) reported were: persistent crying (2666), hypotonic-hyporesponsive episodes (3), encephalopathy (2) and febrile seizures (112). Severe events included: anaphylaxis (2), respiratory distress (1), multiple organ failure (1), sudden death (1), vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (2), toxic shock syndrome (3), and sepsis (1). The 10 deaths and 3 cases of disability were investigated by an expert commission, which concluded that 8 of the 13 severe events were vaccination-related.”

What is the cause of a rash after measles-mumps-rubella vaccination?
“We describe a 17-month-old child with fever and rash after measles-mumps-rubella vaccination. Detection of vaccine-strain
measles virus in his urine by poly
merase chain reaction confirmed the diagnosis of a vaccine reaction rather than wild-type measles. We propose that measles virus should be sought and identified as vaccine or wild-type virus when the relationship between vaccination and measles-like illness is uncertain.”

<h4>Accidental vaccinia vulva vaginitis</h4>
“A thirty year old woman in whom an uncommon complication of smallpox vaccination developed is presented herein. In this case, virus was transmitted from the recently vaccinated child to the vulva and the vagina of the incompletely immune mother. The diagnosis was confirmed by a viral culture and a direct smear.”

<h4>Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis after tetanus vaccination of a pregnant woman in Senegal</h4>
Although neurological complications have been described after tetanus vaccinations, they are rare. The authors report a case of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) in a 28-year-old pregnant woman at a gestational age of 10 weeks, admitted 15 days after a tetanus vaccination, with spastic tetraplegia and sphincter disturbances. Corticosteroid treatment led to partial recovery of the neurological deficit. Differential diagnosis of infectious and demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system is difficult in view of clinical and laboratory aspects of post-vaccination ADEM. Without any specific diagnostic markers, the clinical examination, magnetic resonance imaging and negative etiological findings were key to this diagnosis. Medical staff must bear in mind the possible complications of this vaccine.

<h4>Adventitious agents in viral vaccines: Lessons learned from 4 case studies</h4>
“The four cases are: a) SV40 in polio vaccines; b) bacteriophage in measles and polio vaccines; c) reverse transcriptase in measles and mumps vaccines; and d) porcine circovirus and porcine circovirus DNA sequences in rotavirus vaccines.

<h4>Adverse effect versus quality control of the Fuenzalida-Palacios antirabies vaccine.</h4>

"We evaluated the components of the Fuenzalida-Palacios antirabies vaccine, which is till used in most developing countries in human immunization for treatment and prophylaxis. This vaccine is prepared from newborn mouse brains at 1% concentration. Even though the vaccine is considered to have a low myelin content, it is not fully free of myelin or of other undesirable components that might trigger adverse effects after vaccination. The most severe effect is a post-vaccination neuroparalytic accident associated with Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome. In the present study we demonstrate how the vaccines produced and distributed by different laboratories show different component patterns with different degrees of impurity and with varying protein concentrations, indicating that production processes can vary from one laboratory to another. These differences, which could be resolved using a better quality control process, may affect and impair immunization, with consequent risks and adverse effects after vaccination. We used crossed immunoelectrophoresis to evaluate and demonstrate the possibility of quality control in vaccine production, reducing the risk factors possibly involved in these immunizing products."

<h4>Adverse  events associated with childhood vaccines other than pertussis and rubella. Summary of a report from the Institute of Medicine.</h4>

"The committee found that the evidence favored acceptance of a causal relation between diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome and brachial neuritis, between measles vaccine and anaphylaxis, between oral polio vaccine and Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome, and between unconjugated Hib vaccine and susceptibility to Hib disease. The committee found that the evidence established causality between diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and anaphylaxis, between measles vaccine and death from measles vaccine-strain viral infection, between measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and thrombocytopenia and anaphylaxis, between oral polio vaccine and poliomyelitis and death from polio vaccine-strain viral infection, and between hepatitis B vaccine and anaphylaxis."

<h4>Are toxic biometals destroying your children's future?</h4>

"Cadmium, arsenic, lead, and mercury have been linked to autism, attention deficit disorder, mental retardation and death of children. Mercury in thimerosal found in many vaccines and flu shots contributes significantly to these problems. Decomposition of the thimerosal can produce more toxic compounds, either methylethylmercury or diethylmercury, in the body. These compounds have a toxicity level similar to dimethylmercury. Within the human body, a mitochondrial disorder may release the more toxic form of mercury internally. Young children and pregnant women must minimize internal exposure to the vaccines and flu shots containing mercury."

<h4>Assessment of iatrogenic transmission of HCV in Southern Italy: was the cause the polio vaccination?</h4>

"Since the first studies on hepatitis C virus (HCV) prevalence were published, it has been evident that southern Italy is an area of hyperendemicity. A recent study conducted in southern Italy suggested that the high prevalence of HCV infection might be the result of past iatrogenic transmission. Polio vaccination with the parenteral Salk vaccine between 1956 and 1965 by multiple use of unsafe glass syringes may have been one of the major causes of the spread of HCV infection among southern Italian adults who are now older than 40 years of age. Persons born between the 1940s and early 1960s have a nearly 3-fold increased risk of HCV seropositivity than the younger age group. The findings are consistent with a cohort effect of exposure to the Salk parenteral vaccination."

<h4>Association between SV40 and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</h4>
“Millions of people worldwide were inadvertently exposed to live simian virus 40 (SV40) between 1955 and 1963 through immunization with SV40-contaminated polio vaccines. Although the prevalence of SV40 infections in humans is not known, numerous studies suggest that SV40 is a pathogen resident in the human population today. SV40 is a potent DNA tumor virus that is known to induce primary brain cancers, bone cancers, mesotheliomas, and lymphomas in laboratory animals.”

<h4>Beta-tryptase and quantitative mast-cell increase in a sudden infant death following hexavalent immunization.</h4>
“A fatal case of a 3-month-old female infant, who died within 24 h of vaccination with hexavalent vaccine is presented. Clinical data, post-mortem findings (acute pulmonary oedema, acute pulmonary emphysema), quali-quantitative data collected from immunohistochemical staining (degranulating mast cells) and laboratory analysis with a high level of beta-tryptase in serum, 43.3 microg/l, allows us to conclude that acute respiratory failure likely due to post hexavalent immunization-related shock was the cause of death.”

<h4>Cardiorespiratory events after first immunization in premature infants: a prospective cohort study.</h4>

<p>“OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether all preterm infants born before 33 weeks of gestation need cardiorespiratory monitoring due to the risk of cardiorespiratory disturbances following their first vaccination at 2 months of age.”

<p>“In this cohort of 41 premature infants whose mean gestational age was 30.8 weeks (SD: 1.9), 10 of these had a mild decrease in oxygen saturation or bradycardia; three developed a moderate cardiorespiratory event requiring tactile stimulation.”
“It is recommended that still-hospitalized premature infants receive their first immunizations under cardiorespiratory monitoring, as events were observed during a period of 0-24 hours thereafter.”

<h4>Childhood cancer, intramuscular vitamin K, and pethidine given during labour.</h4>
“…but there was a significant association (p = 0.002) with intramuscular vitamin K (odds ratio 1.97, 95% confidence interval 1.3 to 3.0) when compared with oral vitamin K or no vitamin K. There was no significantly increased risk for children who had been given oral vitamin K when compared with no vitamin K (odds ratio 1.15, 95% confidence interval 0.5 to 2.7). These results could not be accounted for by other factors associated with administration of intramuscular vitamin K, such as type of delivery or admission to a special care baby unit.”
“The only two studies so far to have examined the relation between childhood cancer and intramuscular vitamin K have shown similar results, and the relation is biologically plausible. The prophylactic benefits against haemorrhagic disease are unlikely to exceed the potential adverse effects from intramuscular vitamin K. Since oral vitamin K has major benefits but no obvious adverse effects this could be the prophylaxis of choice.”

<h4>The clinicide phenomenon: an exploration of medical murder</h4>
“The study of medical killers is barely in its infancy. Clinicide is the unnatural death of multiple patients in the course of treatment by a doctor. Serial medical killing is a relatively new phenomenon. The role model is Dr Marcel Petiot, the worst serial killer in French history. More recently, Dr Harold Shipman was Britainâs worst serial killer and in the United States and Zimbabwe, Dr Michael Swango killed 60 patients. A number of doctors have such high patient death rates that it cannot be ignored. At some level, these doctors have an awareness of what they are doing, countered by an overweening refusal to acknowledge the implications or desist from further treatment. Treatment killer offences usually occur on the basis of serial mental illness, but may include the contentious area of euthanasia killing. Doctors have frequently been accomplices in state repression, brutality and genocide in direct contravention to their sanctioned role to relieve suffering and save life. They have become mass murderers on an exponential scale, making any comparison with a doctor killing his own patients almost risible. Many clinicidal doctors have extreme narcissistic personalities, a grandiose view of their own capability and inability to accept that they could be criticized or need assistance from other doctors. Such doctors develop a God-complex, getting a vicarious thrill out of ending suffering and by determining when a person dies.”

<h4>[Complications of pertussis immunization (author transl)].</h4>
“16 cases of neurological disease and/or death shortly after pertussis immunization are reported. Eight patients had convulsions, six with ensuing permanent defects. Severe polymyositis was observed in one case. Five infants died 12 h to 4 days after vaccination: two after acute encephalopathy and three in the form of a sudden unexpected death (SID). In two fatal cases the morphological changes in the brain corresponded to those of pertussis encephalopathy: neuronal degeneration in various parts of the cortex, especially in the region of the ammons horn, and in the cerebellum. There were no signs of inflammation. Three cases underwent forensic autopsy and death was attributed to bronchopulmonary infection. Complete neuropathological work-up was only done in one case, in which the brain was normal. The critique of episodical reports and the demand for prospective studies is appreciated. Knowledge of all possible forms of complications, however, is indispensable for future investigations. Polymyositis and SID have so far not been listed as abnormal reactions to immunization. The majority of our cases became known accidentally from hospital sheets or from discussions with collegues. For a detection of all possible cases a greater awareness of doctors for the problem of pertussis immunization appears necessary. Only another 23 cases have been reported to the health authorities of the state of Lower Saxony during the last 6 to 7 years. Of those, nine were either harmless reactions or diseases probably unrelated to vaccination. Two were cases of SID, 12 and 72 h after vaccination. It is concluded that only a minor proportion of possible complications is presently reported to the health authorities.”

(Lyme disease and autism)
(Incorrect testing methods for Lyme disease and other tick-borne illnesses are currently being used. Vaccines trigger latent infections, which are commonly passed on in utero.) 

<h4>Divergent opinions of proper Lyme disease diagnosis and implications for children co-morbid with autism spectrum disorder.</h4>
“This paper proposes that some children with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the United States have undiagnosed Lyme disease and different testing criteria used by commercial laboratories may be producing false negative results. Two testing protocols will be evaluated; first, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) approved two-tiered Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) or Immunofluorescence Assay (IFA) followed by an IgM and/or IgG Western Blot test. Second, a clinical diagnosis (flu like symptoms, joint pain, fatigue, neurological symptoms, etc.) possibly followed by a Western Blot with a broader criteria for positive bands [1]. The hypothesis proposes that the former criteria may be producing false negative results for some individuals diagnosed with an ASD. Through an online survey parents of 48 children who have a diagnosis of an ASD and have been diagnosed with Lyme disease were asked to fill out the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC) before they started antibiotic therapy and after treatment. Of the 48 parents surveyed 45 of them (94%) indicated their child initially tested negative using the two-tiered CDC/IDSA approved test. The parents sought a second physician who diagnosed their child with Lyme disease using the wider range of Western Blot bands. The children were treated with antibiotics and their scores on the ATEC improved. Anecdotal data indicated that some of the children achieved previously unattained developmental milestones after antibiotic therapy began. Protein bands OSP-A and/or OSP-B (Western Blot band 31) and (Western Blot band 34) were found in 44 of 48 patients. These two bands are so specific to Borrelia burgdorferi that they were targeted for use in vaccine trials, yet are not included in the IDSA interpretation of the Western Blot.”

(Shaken baby syndrome and vaccines)
<h4>Elevated blood histamine caused by vaccinations and Vitamin C deficiency may mimic the shaken baby syndrome.</h4>
“The findings of subdural hematoma and retinal hemorrhages in infants, without any documented history of major trauma, do not always indicate child abuse. A combination of ascorbate depletion and the injection of foreign proteins can cause a very high blood histamine level, leading to capillary fragility and venular bleeding. This can be prevented by the administration of vitamin C.”

<h4>Estimating the extent of vaccine-derived poliovirus infection.</h4>
“Eight outbreaks of paralytic polio attributable to circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) have highlighted the risks associated with oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) use in areas of low vaccination coverage and poor hygiene.” 

“Although only 114 virologically-confirmed paralytic cases were identified in the eight cVDPV outbreaks, it is likely that a minimum of hundreds of thousands, and more likely several million individuals were infected during these events, and that many thousands more have been infected by VDPV lineages within outbreaks which have escaped detection.”

<h4>The evidence base for shaken baby syndrome</h4>
“There is every reason to believe that infant deaths following
vaccinations could be prevented or markedly reduced by the administration
of vitamin C before inoculations, instead of the more usual paracetamol
(4, 5). Not only will there be a decrease in the infant death rate; but
also an important reduction in the incidence of cerebral palsy, epilepsy,
cognitive and behavioural problems, and intellectual impairment, can be
expected.”

<h4>Experimental oral polio vaccines and acquired immune deficiency syndrome.</h4>
The simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) of the common chimpanzee is widely acknowledged as the direct ancestor of HIV-1. There is increasing historical evidence that during the late 1950s, kidneys were routinely excised from central African chimpanzees by scientists who were collaborating with the polio vaccine research of Dr Hilary Koprowski, and sent - inter alia - to vaccine-making laboratories in the USA and Africa, and to unspecified destinations in Belgium. While there is no direct evidence that cells from these kidneys were used as a substrate for growing Dr Koprowskiâs oral polio vaccines, there is a startling coincidence between places in Africa where his CHAT vaccine was fed, and the first appearances in the world of HIV-1 group M and group-M-related AIDS. Because of the enormous implications of the hypothesis that AIDS may be an unintended iatrogenic (physician-caused) disease, it is almost inevitable that this theory will engender heated opposition from many of those in the scientific establishment, and those with vested interests.

<h4>Fetal tissue research: an ongoing story of professionally responsible success.</h4>

âThese scientific and medical advances are dependent on the use of fetal tissue from aborted fetuses. While the practice of induced abortion despite societal benefit may be theologically objectionable to some, these practices are professionally responsible. Federal regulations exist to discourage patients from being influenced by the societal benefit of fetal research in arriving at the decision to terminate as well as to prevent researchers from influencing a patientâs decision.â

ð  Human Illness Associated with Use of Veterinary Vaccines</h4>
âIs human exposure to veterinary vaccines a potential public health concern? There is currently limited understanding of the incidence of exposure of individuals to veterinary vaccines or of the consequences of such exposure. In addition, the potential for exposure and for adverse consequences secondary to exposure to veterinary vaccines may be increasing. The increased development and use of veterinary vaccines (including live vaccines), the increased aerosol administration of vaccines, and the increased proportion of individuals in the United States who are immunosuppressed and who may be exposed to these vaccines or to animals shedding the vaccine strains suggest that increased vigilance may be warranted.â

ð  Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines as an option for preventing cervical malignancies: (how) effective and safe?</h4>
âWe carried out a systematic review of HPV vaccine pre- and post-licensure trials to assess the evidence of their effectiveness and safety. We find that HPV vaccine clinical trials design, and data interpretation of both efficacy and safety outcomes, were largely inadequate. Additionally, we note evidence of selective reporting of results from clinical trials (i.e., exclusion of vaccine efficacy figures related to study subgroups in which efficacy might be lower or even negative from peer-reviewed publications). Given this, the widespread optimism regarding HPV vaccines long-term benefits appears to rest on a number of unproven assumptions (or such which are at odd with factual evidence) and significant misinterpretation of available data. For example, the claim that HPV vaccination will result in approximately 70% reduction of cervical cancers is made despite the fact that the clinical trials data have not demonstrated to date that the vaccines have actually prevented a single case of cervical cancer (let alone cervical cancer death), nor that the current overly optimistic surrogate marker-based extrapolations are justified. Likewise, the notion that HPV vaccines have an impressive safety profile is only supported by highly flawed design of safety trials and is contrary to accumulating evidence from vaccine safety surveillance databases and case reports which continue to link HPV vaccination to serious adverse outcomes (including death and permanent disabilities). We thus conclude that further reduction of cervical cancers might be best achieved by optimizing cervical screening (which carries no such risks) and targeting other factors of the disease rather than by the reliance on vaccines with questionable efficacy and safety profiles.â

ð  LESSONS FROM THE SALK POLIO VACCINE: METHODS FOR AND RISKS OF RAPID TRANSLATION</h4>
“Regretfully, the story of polio vaccine was not without tragedy. In April 1955, soon after mass polio vaccination began in the United States, reports trickled in to the Surgeon General concerning atypical cases of paralytic polio. Several paralytic polio cases were reported in California in patients who had received the polio vaccine about a week earlier but the paralysis only affected the arm or leg in which they received the injection. Each of these cases occurred in polio vaccine produced by Cutter pharmaceutical company. The Surgeon General immediately pulled all Cutter polio vaccine, but it was too late; nearly 400,000 children had been inoculated with Cutter polio vaccine and 250 cases of atypical paralytic polio occurred. There were also reports of the Wyeth pharmaceutical company polio vaccine causing paralysis and death in several children in the northeastern United States.
It was soon discovered that some lots of Cutter and Wyeth polio vaccine were insufficiently inactivated with formalin leading to live polio virus in more than 100,000 doses. In fact, 16 lots of Cutter polio vaccine were retested and the first 6 lots produced were positive for live polio virus. These incidents demonstrated the lack of oversight and safeguards put into place before the vaccine was made so widely available.”

ð  Medicine, the media and monetary interests: the need for transparency and professionalism.</h4>
“Emerging evidence suggests that media coverage of medicine is increasingly promotional in nature. Recent Australian examples include misleading newspaper articles on an experimental cancer vaccine and a high profile television current affairs segment on a new influenza drug, which failed to disclose the industry ties of a key expert featured in the report. There are widening concerns that this problem in medical journalism may be exacerbated by the growing commercialisation of medical and scientific research, and the increasing ties between researchers, doctors and pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies. Closer links between industry and medicine are being explicitly encouraged both in academia and the health care sector for the mutual benefits they bring. However, these partnerships are the cause of growing unease within medicine. In the United States, rigorous legislation governing research protocols is being proposed, and in Australia new ethical guidelines covering industry-profession relationships are being promulgated. If one of the mediaâs roles is informing the community about the business of health and medicine in a fair and accurate way, a cultural change in medical journalism is required.”

<h4>Oral polio vaccine and human cancer: a reassessment of SV40 as a contaminant based upon legal documents.</h4>

"The confirmation of the removal by one drug manufacturer, Lederle, has been made public at an international symposium in January 1997, where its representatives stated that all of Lederle's seeds had been tested and screened to assure that it was free from SV40 virus. However, in litigation involving the Lederle oral polio vaccine, the manufacturer's internal documents failed to reveal such removal in all of the seeds. The absence of confirmatory testing of the seeds, as well as testimony of a Lederle manager, indicate that this claim of removal of SV40 and the testing for SV40 in all the seeds cannot be fully substantiated. These legal documents and testimony indicate that the scientific community should not be content with prior assumptions that SV40 could not have been in the oral polio vaccine."

<h4>Oral versus intramuscular phytomenadione: safety and efficacy compared.</h4>

“Oral and intramuscular phytomenadione (vitamin K1) prophylaxis became an issue following the report of a potential carcinogenic effect of intramuscular but not oral phytomenadione prophylaxis. There is increasing evidence, however, that oral phytomenadione prophylaxis is less effective for the prevention of late vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB) than intramuscular prophylaxis. Following a report of an increased cancer risk after intramuscular phytomenadione, a series of papers on this issue appeared. Although an increased risk for solid tumours could almost certainly be excluded, a potential risk for acute lymphatic leukaemia in childhood could not be ruled out definitively. Almost all cases of late VKDB are preventable with intramuscular phytomenadione prophylaxis administered once at birth, whereas a single oral dose given at birth is much less effective. Repeated oral phytomenadione doses given to breast-fed infants either weekly (1 mg) or daily (25 microg) seem to be as effective as intramuscular phytomenadione prophylaxis. The efficacy of 3 oral 2mg doses with the new mixed micellar preparation (‘Konakion MMâ) remains to be established. Although a number of studies have failed to confirm a cancer risk with phytomenadione, these studies have been unable to rule out a risk definitely because absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. A meta-analysis of the available studies might provide 95% confidence intervals narrow enough to exclude even a small cancer risk with some certainty. Oral prophylaxis will probably be as safe as the intramuscular prophylaxis if given daily (25 microg) or weekly (1 mg).”

ð  Polio, hepatitis B and AIDS: an integrative theory on a possible vaccine induced pandemic.
“The hypothesis that simian virus 40 (SV40) infected polio vaccines may be linked to the evolution of acquired immunodeficiency disorder (AIDS), and certain cancers, has been advanced. Most recently, investigators discussed the likelihood of gene-reshuffling following SV40 infection as a precursor to acquired immune dysfunction. Findings of recent SV40 infections in four children born after 1982 suggest infections were transmitted vertically along gene lines. Earlier observations proved activation of a retrovirus gene by a hepatitis B virus (HBV) protein. This paper proposes a new integrative theory on the origin of AIDS. It advances the possibility of genetic recombinations with oncogene activation by HBV involving simian viruses that likely infected polio vaccinated blood donors to the initial hepatitis B (HB) vaccine trials conducted on gay men in New York City and Ugandan Blacks in the early to mid-1970s. The socio-economic and even military ramifications associated with this politically challenging thesis are discussed.”

ð  A possible central mechanism in autism spectrum disorders, part 1.
“The autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of related neurodevelopmental disorders that have been increasing in incidence since the 1980s. Despite a considerable amount of data being collected from cases, a central mechanism has not been offered. A careful review of ASD cases discloses a number of events that adhere to an immunoexcitotoxic mechanism. This mechanism explains the link between excessive vaccination, use of aluminum and ethylmercury as vaccine adjuvants, food allergies, gut dysbiosis, and abnormal formation of the developing brain. It has now been shown that chronic microglial activation is present in autistic brains from age 5 years to age 44 years. A considerable amount of evidence, both experimental and clinical, indicates that repeated microglial activation can initiate priming of the microglia and that subsequent stimulation can produce an exaggerated microglial response that can be prolonged. It is also known that one phenotypic form of microglia activation can result in an outpouring of neurotoxic levels of the excitotoxins, glutamate and quinolinic acid. Studies have shown that careful control of brain glutamate levels is essential to brain pathway development and that excesses can result in arrest of neural migration, as well as dendritic and synaptic loss. It has also been shown that certain cytokines, such as TNF-alpha, can, via its receptor, interact with glutamate receptors to enhance the neurotoxic reaction. To describe this interaction I have coined the term immunoexcitotoxicity, which is described in this article.”

“Adverse events following smallpox vaccination may occur in the vaccinee, in individuals who have contact with the vaccinee (i.e., secondary transmission), or in individuals who have contact with the vaccineeâs contact (i.e., tertiary transmission). In June 2014 at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland, TX, two cases of inadvertent inoculation of vaccinia and one case of a non-viral reaction following vaccination occurred in the security forces training squadron. This includes the first reported case of shaving as the likely source of autoinoculation after contact transmission. This paper describes the diagnosis and treatment of these cases, the outbreak investigation, and steps taken to prevent future transmission.”

“Herein we report the case of a 3-month-old female infant dying suddenly and unexpectedly shortly after being given a hexavalent vaccination. Examination of the brainstem on serial sections revealed bilateral hypoplasia of the arcuate nucleus. The cardiac conduction system presented persistent fetal dispersion and resorptive degeneration. This case offers a unique insight into the possible role of hexavalent vaccine in triggering a lethal outcome in a vulnerable baby. Any case of sudden unexpected death occurring perinatally and in infancy, especially soon after a vaccination, should always undergo a full necropsy study according to our guidelines.”

ð  Gardasil, hair loss 
Telogen effluvium following bivalent human papillomavirus vaccine administration: a report of two cases.
“We describe two cases of telogen effluvium occurring in two 11-year-old children following bivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine administration. The two children began to lose their hair following the second HPV vaccine dose. Alopecia worsened following the third vaccine dose and then resolved spontaneously within a few months. In both cases, laboratory analysis and psychiatric evaluation excluded causes other than anti-HPV vaccine. Social discomfort and isolation were associated with alopecia in the two children. The clinical presentation was consistent with a pattern of telogen effluvium. The identification of specific vaccine components responsible for triggering the adverse event remains difficult. In similar cases, suspension of immunization is not recommended, as it provides health benefits that overcome the possible adverse effect of transient telogen effluvium. Caregivers should ensure psychiatric support to their patients to manage the social and emotional distress that might be associated with hair loss.”

ð  Tetanus vaccine may be laced with anti-fertility drug. International / developing countries.
“A priest, president of Human Life International (HLI) based in Maryland, has asked Congress to investigate reports of women in some developing countries unknowingly receiving a tetanus vaccine laced with the anti-fertility drug human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). If it is true, he wants Congress to publicly condemn the mass vaccinations and to cut off funding to UN agencies and other involved organizations. The natural hormone hCG is needed to maintain pregnancy. The hormone would produce antibodies against hCG to prevent pregnancy. In the fall of 1994, the Pro Life Committee of Mexico was suspicious of the protocols for the tetanus toxoid campaign because they excluded all males and children and called for multiple injections of the vaccine in only women of reproductive age. Yet, one injection provides protection for at least 10 years. The Committee had vials of the tetanus vaccine analyzed for hCG. It informed HLI about the tetanus toxoid vaccine. HLI then told its World Council members and HLI affiliates in more than 60 countries. Similar tetanus vaccines laced with hCG have been uncovered in the Philippines and in Nicaragua. In addition to the World Health Organization (WHO), other organizations involved in the development of an anti-fertility vaccine using hCG include the UN Population Fund, the UN Development Programme, the World Bank, the Population Council, the Rockefeller Foundation, the US National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, and Uppsala, Helsinki, and Ohio State universities. The priest objects that, if indeed the purpose of the mass vaccinations is to prevent pregnancies, women are uninformed, unsuspecting, and unconsenting victims.”

ð  Transmission of mumps virus from mumps-vaccinated individuals to close contacts.
“During a recent mumps epidemic in the Netherlands caused by a genotype D mumps virus strain, we investigated the potential of vaccinated people to spread mumps disease to close contacts. We compared mumps viral titers of oral fluid specimens obtained by quantitative PCR from vaccinated (n=60) and unvaccinated (n=111) mumps patients. We also investigated the occurrence of mumps infection among the household contacts of vaccinated mumps patients. We found that viral titers are higher for unvaccinated patients than for vaccinated patients during the 1st 3 days after onset of disease. While no symptomatic cases were reported among the household contacts (n=164) of vaccinated mumps patients (n=36), there were cases with serological evidence of asymptomatic infection among vaccinated household contacts (9 of 66 vaccinated siblings). For two of these siblings, the vaccinated index patient was the most probable source of infection. We conclude that, in this particular outbreak, the risk of a close contact becoming infected by vaccinated patients was small, but present.

ð  An unmasking phenomenon in an observational post-licensure safety study of adolescent girls and young women.
“Our recent experience in a post-licensure safety study of autoimmune conditions following the quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine in 189,629 girls and young women ages 9-26 years led us to question the adequacy of the exclusion of Day 0 events to prevent the erroneous association of prevalent conditions with vaccination. Of the 18 confirmed cases of Gravesâ disease diagnosed in days 1-60 following vaccination, only 6 cases appeared to be truly new onset. Among the remaining 12 cases, 2 cases had abnormal thyroid stimulating hormone or thyroxine labs drawn prior to or on Day 0 but had no documented pre-existing symptoms. The other 10 cases had mention of symptoms of hyperthyroidism referencing a period prior to first HPV-4 dose. This ‘unmaskingâ phenomenon, due to health care visits that include vaccination and new workups of preexisting symptoms, may not be adequately controlled through the exclusion of Day 0 events.”

ð  [Vaccines, biotechnology and their connection with induced abortion].
“Diploid cells (WI-38, MRC-5) vaccines have their origin in induced abortions. Among these vaccines we find the following: rubella, measles, mumps, rabies, polio, smallpox, hepatitis A, chickenpox, and herpes zoster. Nowadays, other abortion tainted vaccines cultivated on transformed cells (293, PER.C6) are in the pipeline: flu, Respiratory Syncytial and parainfluenza viruses, HIV, West Nile virus, Ebola, Marburg and Lassa, hepatitis B and C, foot and mouth disease, Japanese encephalitis, dengue, tuberculosis, anthrax, plague, tetanus and malaria. The same method is used for the production of monoclonal antibodies and other proteins, gene therapy and genomics. Technology enables us to develop the aforementioned products without resorting to induced abortion. Full disclosure of the cell origin in the labelling of vaccines and other products must be supported. There are vaccines from non-objectionable sources which should be made available to the public. When no alternative vaccines exist, ethical research must be promoted. Non-objectionable sources in the production of monoclonal antibodies, gene therapy and genomics must be encouraged. It is not be consistent to abstain from products originated in embryonic stem cells and at the same time approve of products obtained from induced abortions. It is of paramount importance to avoid that induced abortion technology seeps into every field of Medicine.”

ð [Vaccines, biotechnology and their connection with induced abortion].
“Diploid cells (WI-38, MRC-5) vaccines have their origin in induced abortions. Among these vaccines we fi nd the following: rubella, measles, mumps, rabies, polio, smallpox, hepatitis A, chickenpox, and herpes zoster. Nowadays, other abortion tainted vaccines cultivated on transformed cells (293, PER.C6) are in the pipeline: flu, Respiratory Syncytial and parainfluenza viruses, HIV, West Nile virus, Ebola, Marburg and Lassa, hepatitis B and C, foot and mouth disease, Japanese encephalitis, dengue, tuberculosis, anthrax, plague, tetanus and malaria. The same method is used for the production of monoclonal antibodies and other proteins, gene therapy and genomics. Technology enables us to develop the aforementioned products without resorting to induced abortion. Full disclosure of the cell origin in the labelling of vaccines and other products must be supported. There are vaccines from non-objectionable sources which should be made available to the public. When no alternative vaccines exist, ethical research must be promoted. Non-objectionable sources in the production of monoclonal antibodies, gene therapy and genomics must be encouraged. It is not be consistent to abstain from products originated in embryonic stem cells and at the same time approve of products obtained from induced abortions. It is of paramount importance to avoid that induced abortion technology seeps into every field of Medicine.”

Etiology of fibromyalgia: the possible role of infection and vaccination. 
“Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS), a condition characterized by widespread pain and diffuse tenderness, is considered a multifactorial disorder. FMS is now recognized as one of the “central” pain syndromes. Environmental and genetic factors play a role in the pathogenesis of FMS. Various triggers including trauma and stress as well as infections, may precipitate the development of FMS. Certain infections including hepatitis C virus, HIV and Lyme disease have been temporally associated with the development of FMS. There is some evidence for the possible role of vaccinations in triggering the development of FMS and related syndromes, however this association remains to be established.”

Fibromyalgia, infection and vaccination: two more parts in the etiological puzzle.
“As the pathogenesis of fibromyalgia continues to raise debate, multiple putative triggers have been implicated. The current review summarizes the available data linking fibromyalgia to either infection or vaccination. Multiple infectious agents have been associated with the development of either full-blown fibromyalgia (e.g. hepatits C), or with symptom complexes extensively overlapping with that syndrome (e.g. chronic Lyme disease). The cases of Lyme disease, mycoplasma, hepatits C and HIV are detailed. Despite the described associations, no evidence is available demonstrating the utility of antibiotic or anti-viral treatment in the management of fibromyalgia. Possible mechanistic links between fibromyalgia and HIV are reviewed. Associations have been described between various vaccinations and symptom complexes including fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome. The case of Gulf War syndrome, a functional multisystem entity sharing many clinical characteristics with fibromyalgia is discussed, with emphasis on the possibility of association with administration of multiple vaccinations during deployment in the Persian Gulf and the interaction with stress and trauma. Based on this example a model is proposed, wherein vaccinations function as co-triggers for the development of functional disorders including fibromyalgia, in conjunction with additional contributing factors.”

                                Anaphylactic reactions to measles-mumps-rubella vaccine in three children with allergies to hen’s egg and cow’s milk.
“AIM: Allergies to hen’s egg and cow’s milk are the most frequent food allergies in infancy and childhood. Current guidelines recommend safe administration of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine in egg allergic patients.
METHODS: We present three cases of anaphylaxis that we encountered after MMR vaccination in children sensitized to hen’s egg and cow’s milk.
RESULTS: Even though MMR vaccine is generally known to be safe in children with egg allergy, there may still be isolated cases of anaphylaxis.
CONCLUSION: Therefore, we recommend that all children not only those who were sensitized to foods should receive the MMR vaccination in a setting that is equipped to deal with anaphylactic reactions. As stated by WHO in immunization safety surveillance, ‘Each vaccinator must have an emergency kit with adrenaline, and be familiar with its dosage and administration’.

Anaphylaxis to succinylated gelatin in a patient with a meat allergy: galactose-α(1, 3)-galactose (α-gal) as antigenic determinant.
Specific immunoglobulin E (sIgE) antibodies towards the galactose-α(1,3)-galactose (α-gal) moieties may elicit life-threatening and fatal anaphylactic reactions. Patients sensitized to α-gal moieties from mammalian meat may also react towards mammalian gelatins and gelatin-containing drugs such as bovine gelatin-based colloid plasma substitute. The case of a 56 year old woman with a meat allergy who suffered anaphylaxis to succinylated gelatin is reported.

Gastrointestinal immunopathology and food allergy.
“In contrast to the beneficial expressions of gastrointestinal-associated lymphoid tissue, which are seen with relevance to newer methods of delivery of vaccines directly applied to the gastrointestinal mucosal surfaces (eg, oral poliovirus, rotavirus, Salmonella typhi vaccines), the adverse consequences of a mucosal immune response gone astray are evidenced in many diseases such as FA. A classification of clinical disorders associated with FA based on classic mechanisms of immunologic injury is presented, which includes the following: (1) IgE-mediated, (2) non-IgE-mediated, and (3) mixed IgE- and non-IgE-mediated disorders. Our study of immunologic disturbance in patients with non-IgE FA revealed a pattern of increased CD4+ and decreased TH1 cell counts in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in contrast to patients with celiac disease, where a pattern of increased CD8+ and TH1 cell counts in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and increased CD8+ cell counts was seen.”

Pertussis adjuvant prolongs intestinal hypersensitivity.
“CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate nanogram quantities of PT, when administered with a food protein, result in long-term sensitization to the antigen, and altered intestinal neuroimmune function. These data suggest that exposure to bacterial pathogens may prolong the normally transient immune responsiveness to inert food antigens.”

🛑 A possible central mechanism in autism spectrum disorders, part 1.
The autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of related neurodevelopmental disorders that have been increasing in incidence since the 1980s. Despite a considerable amount of data being collected from cases, a central mechanism has not been offered. A careful review of ASD cases discloses a number of events that adhere to an immunoexcitotoxic mechanism. This mechanism explains the link between excessive vaccination, use of aluminum and ethylmercury as vaccine adjuvants, food allergies, gut dysbiosis, and abnormal formation of the developing brain. It has now been shown that chronic microglial activation is present in autistic brains from age 5 years to age 44 years. A considerable amount of evidence, both experimental and clinical, indicates that repeated microglial activation can initiate priming of the microglia and that subsequent stimulation can produce an exaggerated microglial response that can be prolonged. It is also known that one phenotypic form of microglia activation can result in an outpouring of neurotoxic levels of the excitotoxins, glutamate and quinolinic acid. Studies have shown that careful control of brain glutamate levels is essential to brain pathway development and that excesses can result in arrest of neural migration, as well as dendritic and synaptic loss. It has also been shown that certain cytokines, such as TNF-alpha, can, via its receptor, interact with glutamate receptors to enhance the neurotoxic reaction. To describe this interaction I have coined the term immunoexcitotoxicity, which is described in this article.”

Association of acute cerebellar ataxia and human papilloma virus vaccination: a case report.
“INTRODUCTION: We report the case of a patient who developed symptoms of acute cerebellar ataxia (ACA) after administration of the human papilloma virus (HPV)-16/18 vaccine.
PATIENT AND METHOD: This patient developed symptoms of ACA, including nausea, vertigo, severe limb and truncal ataxia, and bilateral spontaneous continuous horizontal nystagmus with irregular rhythm, 12 days after administration of the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted cervical cancer vaccine. After this, the patient received methylprednisolone pulse and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapies as well as immunoadsorption plasmapheresis.
RESULTS: Severe ACA symptoms did not improve after methylprednisolone pulse and IVIG therapies, but the patient recovered completely after immunoadsorption plasmapheresis.
CONCLUSION: This temporal association strongly suggests that ACA was induced by the vaccination.”

Autoimmune/auto-inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA) after quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccination in Colombians: a call for personalised medicine.
“This was a case study in which 3 patients with autoimmune/auto-inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA) after quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccination (HPV) were evaluated and described. All the patients were women. Diagnosis consisted of HLA-B27 enthesitis related arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematous, respectively. Our results highlight the risk of developing ASIA after HPV vaccination and may serve to increase the awareness of such a complication. Factors that are predictive of developing autoimmune diseases should be examined at the population level in order to establish preventive measures in at-risk individuals for whom healthcare should be personalized and participatory.”

A case of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) following Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination.
“A 15-year-old young woman received the Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines. Following the second HPV vaccination, intermittent fever, myalgia, arthritis and malar rash developed, and she was admitted to our hospital. Laboratory studies showed positive results for antinuclear antibody, anti-dsDNA antibody and anti-Sm antibody. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was diagnosed according to the Systemic Lupus International Collaborative Clinics 2012. Magnetic resonance imaging showed abnormal hyperintense areas in the fascia, and en bloc biopsy showed fasciitis. Treatment with prednisolone resulted in an amelioration of the symptoms. Reportedly, SLE developed after HPV vaccinations in some patients. Most such patients have a past or family history of autoimmune disease and presented SLE symptoms after the second vaccination. We describe herein a patient in whom SLE developed in association with HPV vaccination.”

CNS demyelination and quadrivalent HPV vaccination.
“Vaccination is generally considered safe in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). We report five patients who presented with multifocal or atypical demyelinating syndromes within 21 days of immunization with the quadrivalent human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine, Gardasil. Although the target population for vaccination, young females, has an inherently high risk for MS, the temporal association with demyelinating events in these cases may be explained by the potent immuno-stimulatory properties of HPV virus-like particles which comprise the vaccine. A prospective case-control study of patients with MS or clinically isolated demyelinating syndromes receiving the Gardasil vaccine may provide relevant safety data in this population.”

Current Safety Concerns with Human Papillomavirus Vaccine: A Cluster Analysis of Reports in VigiBase® (2017)
“Cluster analysis reveals additional reports of AEs following HPV vaccination that are serious in nature and describe symptoms that overlap those reported in cases from the recent safety signals (POTS, CRPS, and CFS), but which do not report explicit diagnoses. While the causal association between HPV vaccination and these AEs remains uncertain, more extensive analyses of spontaneous reports can better identify the relevant case series for thorough signal evaluation.”

🛑 Demyelinating disease and polyvalent human papilloma virus vaccination
“Since its inception, the polyvalent vaccine against the human papilloma virus (HPV), Gardasil, has generated some controversies as a temporal relationship between the administrations of the vaccine and the development of a few autoimmune diseases, such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), multiple sclerosis (MS) and Guillain–Barre syndrome have been reported.1–3 We encountered two cases whose initial presentation of CNS demyelination followed in close time relationship the administration of Gardasil vaccine and we discuss their possible association.
Case No 1
A 19-year-old woman received two doses of Gardasil, 3 months apart, and approximately 1 month after the second dose, she developed numbness to the right foot that within 1 day extended to the contralateral foot and was associated with mid-thoracic back pain. Her neurological examination was only significant for the altered perception to touch to the feet. Deep tendon reflexes were normal and plantar reflexes in flexion. MRI of cervical and thoracic spine revealed a total of three lesions with characteristic demyelinating appearance, one of those in the thoracic spine was contrast-enhancing (figure 1A–C). MRI brain demonstrated one additional white matter lesion also consistent with a demyelinating process.”

[Demyelinating disease and vaccination of the human papillomavirus].
“CASE REPORTS: We describe the cases of four young women that developed demyelinating disease after the vaccination of the HPV, with a rank of time between the administration of the dose and the development of the clinical of seven days to a month, with similar symptoms with the successive doses. We have described six episodes coinciding after the vaccination.
CONCLUSIONS: Have been described seizures, autoimmune disorders such as Guillain-Barre syndrome, transverse myelitis, or motor neuron disease, probably adverse effects following immunization by HPV vaccine. So we suggest that vaccine may trigger an immunological mechanism leading to demyelinating events, perhaps in predisposed young.”

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines as an option for preventing cervical malignancies: (how) effective and safe?
“We carried out a systematic review of HPV vaccine pre- and post-licensure trials to assess the evidence of their effectiveness and safety. We find that HPV vaccine clinical trials design, and data interpretation of both efficacy and safety outcomes, were largely inadequate. Additionally, we note evidence of selective reporting of results from clinical trials (i.e., exclusion of vaccine efficacy figures related to study subgroups in which efficacy might be lower or even negative from peer-reviewed publications). Given this, the widespread optimism regarding HPV vaccines long-term benefits appears to rest on a number of unproven assumptions (or such which are at odd with factual evidence) and significant misinterpretation of available data. For example, the claim that HPV vaccination will result in approximately 70% reduction of cervical cancers is made despite the fact that the clinical trials data have not demonstrated to date that the vaccineshave actually prevented a single case of cervical cancer (let alone cervical cancer death), nor that the current overly optimistic surrogate marker-based extrapolations are justified. Likewise, the notion that HPV vaccines have an impressive safety profile is only supported by highly flawed design of safety trials and is contrary to accumulating evidence from vaccine safety surveillance databases and case reports which continue to link HPV vaccination to serious adverse outcomes (including death and permanent disabilities). We thus conclude that further reduction of cervical cancers might be best achieved by optimizing cervical screening (which carries no such risks) and targeting other factors of the disease rather than by the reliance on vaccines with questionable efficacy and safety profiles.”

Involvement of chronic epipharyngitis in autoimmune (auto-inflammatory) syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA). 2017 
“The epipharynx is an immunologically active site even under normal conditions, and enhanced immunologic activation is prone to occur in response to an upper respiratory infection, air pollution, and possibly to vaccine adjuvants. Due to the potential link between the central nervous system and immune function, a relationship between epipharyngitis and autonomic nervous disturbance as well as autoimmune disease has been suggested. Various functional somatic symptoms have been described after human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination, although a causal relationship has not been established. We examined the epipharynx in young women showing functional somatic symptoms following HPV vaccination. Surprisingly, despite having minimal symptoms involving the pharynx, all patients were found to have severe epipharyngitis. In addition, significant improvement in symptoms was seen in most patients who underwent epipharyngeal treatment. Thus, we speculate that the chronic epipharyngitis potentially caused by the vaccine adjuvant may be involved in the pathogenesis of functional somatic syndrome (FSS) post-HPV vaccination. Further, we suggest that epipharyngeal treatment may be effective for various types of FSS regardless of the initial cause, as well as for some autoimmune diseases, and that this may be an important direction in future research.”

Opsoclonus Myoclonus after human papilloma virus vaccine in a pediatric patient.
“Opsoclonus-Myoclonus Syndrome (OMS) is a rare neurologic condition comprised of the two hallmark signs of dysmetric ocular ataxia and myoclonic jerks of the extremities. The eye movements have been described as “dancing eyes”. The eyes dart involuntarily away from the point of visual fixation or pursuit in a manner that can be considered a myoclonic jerk of the extra-ocular muscles. When the patient attempts to align the gaze on a point, there may be dysmetric overshoot of the eye movement. Myoclonic movements of the extremities occur at rest, and intended actions are ataxic. The mean age of presentation of OMS in childhood is 14 months, and it presents as a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with an underlying tumor in 50–60% of the cases [1,2], most commonly neuroblastoma or ganglioneuroblastoma. Recent research has revealed the presence of several auto-antibodies including anti-Hu, anti-Ri, α-Enolase, KSRP and NLK [3] in patients with OMS. These antibodies bind to an array of targets in the cerebellum and may manifest as oligoclonal bands in cerebrospinal fluid. The syndrome is often associated with behavioral changes such as aggression, irritability, and insomnia. Post-vaccine OMS is not well described in the pediatric population. The patient was a fully vaccinated and developmentally appropriate 11-year-old female with seasonal allergies and mild asthma. Her initial symptoms consisted of a sudden onset of increased “moodiness” causing uncharacteristic anger and depression. These symptoms presented approximately 15 days after receiving her first human papilloma virus (HPV) (Gardisil®) vaccination on 11/26/2007. The uncharacteristic behavior persisted and 1 month after the initial mood changes she noted that her “eyes were doing weird things” and she perceived that visual images went “back and forth in circles”. The abnormal ocular movements occurred with her eyes closed or open, and could be only minimally suppressed with great effort. There were no other symptoms at this time, however, her eye symptoms became more frequent and troubling to her. She then received a second HPV vaccination 2 months later in addition to a meningococcal (Menactra®) vaccine. Four days after these vaccinations she developed noticeable worsening of the eye movements and acute perception of dizziness, which she described as the “room is spinning.” This was accompanied by leg weakness requiring assistance to walk and “jumpy arms.” Family history reveals a cousin with childhood epilepsy, maternal great aunt with lupus, maternal grandfather died of a ruptured aneurysm at age 40, and mother with fibromyalgia, but no movement disorders or paraneoplastic syndromes. There is one case report of post-vaccine OMS in a 30-year-old female with an allergic diathesis [4]. Her symptoms began two weeks after a vaccine. She failed to improve with corticosteroid therapy, but IVIG was not used. She derived clinical benefit from benzodiazepines and her symptoms resolved completely within 10 months.”

Potential cross-reactivity between HPV16 L1 protein and sudden death-associated antigens.
“In exploring the primary sequence of the human papilloma virus (HPV) 16 major capsid L1 protein for peptide sharing with human proteins, we find that 34 pentamers from the viral capsid protein are shared with human proteins that, when altered, have been linked to short QT syndrome, arrhythmogenic cardiac disorders, cardiovascular diseases and sudden death. In particular, nine out of the 34 viral pentamers are present in a human protein, titin, alterations of which have been linked to cardiac failure and sudden cardiac death. The present data may help evaluate the potential crossreactivity risks in anti-tumor vaccination protocols based on HPV16 L1 protein.”

A qualitative study of women who experience side effects from human papillomavirus vaccination.
“The women reported feeling stigmatised by GPs and doctors and they felt that these professionals did not acknowledge their symptoms, often assuming that they were due to psychological distress. The lack of acceptance from family and friends had led the women to distance themselves from others and lead a more socially isolated life. The women believed that a diagnosis could validate their symptoms and help others accept their condition.
CONCLUSIONS: The women felt exceedingly physically and mentally confined in their everyday life, which led them to live a more restricted and solitary life. Since other people tended not to acknowledge their symptoms, the women’s illness behaviour was poorly accepted. The women generally distrusted Danish healthcare as they had experienced stigmatisation from physicians and did not trust the evidence for the safety of the vaccine.”

Serious adverse events after HPV vaccination: a critical review of randomized trials and post-marketing case series.
Martínez-Lavín M, et al. Clin Rheumatol. 2017.
“This article critically reviews HPV vaccine serious adverse events described in pre-licensure randomized trials and in post-marketing case series. HPV vaccine randomized trials were identified in PubMed. Safety data were extracted. Post-marketing case series describing HPV immunization adverse events were reviewed. Most HPV vaccine randomized trials did not use inert placebo in the control group. Two of the largest randomized trials found significantly more severe adverse events in the tested HPV vaccine arm of the study. Compared to 2871 women receiving aluminum placebo, the group of 2881 women injected with the bivalent HPV vaccine had more deaths on follow-up (14 vs. 3, p = 0.012). Compared to 7078 girls injected with the 4-valent HPV vaccine, 7071 girls receiving the 9-valent dose had more serious systemic adverse events (3.3 vs. 2.6%, p = 0.01). For the 9-valent dose, our calculated number needed to seriously harm is 140 (95% CI, 796-53). The number needed to vaccinate is 1757 (95% CI, 131 to infinity). Practically, none of the serious adverse events occurring in any arm of both studies were judged to be vaccine-related. Pre-clinical trials, post-marketing case series, and the global drug adverse reaction database (VigiBase) describe similar post-HPV immunization symptom clusters. Two of the largest randomized HPV vaccine trials unveiled more severe adverse events in the tested HPV vaccine arm of the study. Nine-valent HPV vaccine has a worrisome number needed to vaccinate/number needed to harm quotient. Pre-clinical trials and post-marketing case series describe similar post-HPV immunization symptoms.”

Severe manifestations of autoimmune syndrome induced by adjuvants (Shoenfeld’s syndrome).
“From 2011 to 2016, we identified 4479 ASIA cases, of them 305 fulfilled arbitrary criteria of severe ASIA including our case presentation and 11 deaths. The majority of severe ASIA cases were related to HPV vaccine, silicone, influenza vaccine and mineral oil injections. The interval from exposition to severe manifestation was from 2 days to 23 years. (1) This is the first study that analyzes all cases published on ASIA with severe manifestations. (2) The current HPV vaccine is both effective and generally safe. However, it should be noted that severe autoimmune side effects have been reported in several studies. Severe ASIA may be observed after influenza vaccines, and other vaccines. (3) Efforts should be made to discover the connection between adjuvants, autoimmunity and autoimmune diseases, because there is an increase in cases severe and life-threatening of ASIA.”

Teenage boys shouldn’t be given HPV vaccine, says joint committee (2017)
“The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination programme should not be extended to boys, as it would not be cost effective, the UK Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has said in an interim ruling.1
Since 2008 girls aged 12 and 13 in the UK have been offered HPV vaccination to protect against the development of cervical cancer in later life. HPV infects males and females, and in boys and men it can progress to cause anal, penile, and oropharyngeal and oral cavity cancers, and anogenital warts.
In 2013 Australia became the first country in the world to fund a national HPV vaccination scheme for boys.2 A pilot scheme to evaluate …”

🛑 Telogen effluvium following bivalent human papillomavirus vaccine administration: a report of two cases.
“We describe two cases of telogen effluvium occurring in two 11-year-old children following bivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine administration. The two children began to lose their hair following the second HPV vaccine dose. Alopecia worsened following the third vaccine dose and then resolved spontaneously within a few months. In both cases, laboratory analysis and psychiatric evaluation excluded causes other than anti-HPV vaccine. Social discomfort and isolation were associated with alopecia in the two children. The clinical presentation was consistent with a pattern of telogen effluvium. The identification of specific vaccine components responsible for triggering the adverse event remains difficult. In similar cases, suspension of immunization is not recommended, as it provides health benefits that overcome the possible adverse effect of transient telogen effluvium. Caregivers should ensure psychiatric support to their patients to manage the social and emotional distress that might be associated with hair loss.”

Two Cases of Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis Following Vaccination Against Human Papilloma Virus.
“We herein present two cases of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) following vaccination against human papilloma virus (HPV). Case 1 experienced diplopia and developed an unstable gait 14 days after a second vaccination of Cervarix. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an isolated small, demyelinating lesion in the pontine tegmentum. Case 2 experienced a fever and limb dysesthesia 16 days after a second vaccination of Gardasil. Brain MRI revealed hyperintense lesion in the pons with slight edema on a T2-weighted image. Both cases resolved completely. It is important to accumulate further data on confirmed cases of ADEM temporally associated with HPV vaccination.”

🛑 An unmasking phenomenon in an observational post-licensure safety study of adolescent girls and young women.
“Our recent experience in a post-licensure safety study of autoimmune conditions following the quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine in 189,629 girls and young women ages 9-26 years led us to question the adequacy of the exclusion of Day 0 events to prevent the erroneous association of prevalent conditions with vaccination. Of the 18 confirmed cases of Graves’ disease diagnosed in days 1-60 following vaccination, only 6 cases appeared to be truly new onset. Among the remaining 12 cases, 2 cases had abnormal thyroid stimulating hormone or thyroxine labs drawn prior to or on Day 0 but had no documented pre-existing symptoms. The other 10 cases had mention of symptoms of hyperthyroidism referencing a period prior to first HPV-4 dose. This ‘unmasking’ phenomenon, due to health care visits that include vaccination and new workups of preexisting symptoms, may not be adequately controlled through the exclusion of Day 0 events.”

Vaccinations and secondary immune thrombocytopenia with antiphospholipid antibodies by human papillomavirus vaccine.
“A 13-year-old girl developed immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and concomitant positive antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) following vaccination with a quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. During the course of a disease, she developed clinical manifestation with bleeding and she was treated with intravenous immunoglobulins. Consequently, the number of her platelets remained critically low and she was put on corticosteroids and rituximab. Since then, her platelet count remain within the normal range, but her aPL are still present.

Vaccine-related serious adverse events might have been under-recognized in the pivotal HPV vaccine randomized trial (2017)
“To the Editor:
After seeing several healthy girls developing a severe chronic illness soon after HPV vaccination [1], I analyzed all HPV vaccine randomized controlled trials.
The overwhelming majority of pre-licensure HPV vaccine randomized trials did not use inert placebo as comparator. The largest nine-valent HPV immunization trial [2] compared the newly developed nine-valent HPV vaccine vs. the four-valent HPV formulation. The innovative nine-valent HPV dose has more than double HPV virus-like particles and aluminum adjuvant than the previous formulation. Double-blind safety analysis contrasted 7071 subjects immunized with the nine-valent vaccine vs. 7078 who had the four-valent dose. The nine-valent cohort had significantly more systemic serious adverse events; n = 233 (3.3%) vs. n = 183 (2.6%) in the other group. Our calculated 2 × 2 contingency table pvalue was 0.0125. Oddly, only two subjects (0%) in each group were judged to have a vaccine-related serious adverse event. The authors did not comment on this incongruity.
This discrepancy arising from a pivotal large randomized double-blind trial suggests that nine-valent HPV vaccine-related serious adverse events were under-recognized. This emerging information casts further doubt on HPV vaccine safety.”

Gastrointestinal immunopathology and food allergy.
“In contrast to the beneficial expressions of gastrointestinal-associated lymphoid tissue, which are seen with relevance to newer methods of delivery of vaccines directly applied to the gastrointestinal mucosal surfaces (eg, oral poliovirus, rotavirus, Salmonella typhi vaccines), the adverse consequences of a mucosal immune response gone astray are evidenced in many diseases such as FA. A classification of clinical disorders associated with FA based on classic mechanisms of immunologic injury is presented, which includes the following: (1) IgE-mediated, (2) non-IgE-mediated, and (3) mixed IgE- and non-IgE-mediated disorders. Our study of immunologic disturbance in patients with non-IgE FA revealed a pattern of increased CD4+ and decreased TH1 cell counts in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in contrast to patients with celiac disease, where a pattern of increased CD8+ and TH1 cell counts in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and increased CD8+ cell counts was seen.”

Is measles vaccination a risk factor for inflammatory bowel disease?
Thompson NP, et al. Lancet. 1995.
“Measles virus may persist in intestinal tissue, particularly that affected by Crohnâs disease, and early exposure to measles may be a risk factor for the development of Crohnâs disease. Crohnâs disease and ulcerative colitis occur in the same families and may share a common aetiology. In view of the rising incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (Crohnâs disease and ulcerative colitis), we examined the impact of measles vaccination upon these conditions. Prevalences of Crohnâs disease, ulcerative colitis, coeliac disease, and peptic ulceration were determined in 3545 people who had received live measles vaccine in 1964 as part of a measles vaccine trial. A longitudinal birth cohort of 11,407 subjects was one unvaccinated comparison cohort, and 2541 partners of those vaccinated was another. Compared with the birth cohort, the relative risk of developing Crohnâs disease in the vaccinated group was 3.01 (95% CI 1.45-6.23) and of developing ulcerative colitis was 2.53 (1.15-5.58). There was no significant difference between these two groups in coeliac disease prevalence. Increased prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease, but not coeliac disease or peptic ulceration, was found in the vaccinated cohort compared with their partners. These findings suggest that measles virus may play a part in the development not only of Crohnâs disease but also of ulcerative colitis.”

ð Pertussis adjuvant prolongs intestinal hypersensitivity.
“CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate nanogram quantities of PT, when administered with a food protein, result in long-term sensitization to the antigen, and altered intestinal neuroimmune function. These data suggest that exposure to bacterial pathogens may prolong the normally transient immune responsiveness to inert food antigens.”

Poliovirus Infections in Four Unvaccinated Children — Minnesota, August-October 2005
“On September 29, 2005, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) identified poliovirus type 1 in an unvaccinated, immunocompromised infant girl aged 7 months (the index patient) in an Amish community whose members predominantly were unvaccinated for polio. The patient has no paralysis; the source of the patientâs infection is unknown. Subsequently, poliovirus infections in three other children within the index patientâs community have been documented.”
“Partial sequencing of the virus capsid protein coding region (VP1) of the poliovirus genome at the MDH laboratory identified it as a vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV). VDPVs are poliovirus strains derived from one of the three Sabin poliovirus strains in oral polio vaccine (OPV) that have &gt;1% difference in nucleotide sequence from the prototype vaccine virus.”

ð A possible central mechanism in autism spectrum disorders, part 1.
“The autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of related neurodevelopmental disorders that have been increasing in incidence since the 1980s. Despite a considerable amount of data being collected from cases, a central mechanism has not been offered. A careful review of ASD cases discloses a number of events that adhere to an immunoexcitotoxic mechanism. This mechanism explains the link between excessive vaccination, use of aluminum and ethylmercury as vaccine adjuvants, food allergies, gut dysbiosis, and abnormal formation of the developing brain. It has now been shown that chronic microglial activation is present in autistic brains from age 5 years to age 44 years. A considerable amount of evidence, both experimental and clinical, indicates that repeated microglial activation can initiate priming of the microglia and that subsequent stimulation can produce an exaggerated microglial response that can be prolonged. It is also known that one phenotypic form of microglia activation can result in an outpouring of neurotoxic levels of the excitotoxins, glutamate and quinolinic acid. Studies have shown that careful control of brain glutamate levels is essential to brain pathway development and that excesses can result in arrest of neural migration, as well as dendritic and synaptic loss. It has also been shown that certain cytokines, such as TNF-alpha, can, via its receptor, interact with glutamate receptors to enhance the neurotoxic reaction. To describe this interaction I have coined the term immunoexcitotoxicity, which is described in this article.”

Post-rotavirus vaccine intussusception in identical twins: A case report.
“Two infants aged 3 months, vaccinated against rotavirus. After about a week, one of the 2 identical infants presented inconsolable crying, vomiting, loose stools mixed with blood, and was diagnosed with bowel obstruction with intussusception. He was operated in urgency. After a few hours, his brother presented vomiting, and was admitted to our Hospital for suspected intussusception.”

Risk of intussusception following rotavirus vaccination: An evidence based meta-analysis of cohort and case-control studies. (2017)
“RESULTS: Six cohort studies involving 4506265 total first doses and five case-control studies involving a total sample of 9643 children were included in this analysis. The cohort data revealed that there was an associated increased risk of intussusception after the first 7days post first dose of the vaccine (RR:3.71, 95% CI:1.08-12.69) and after receiving all doses of the rotavirus vaccine (RR:3.47, 95% CI:1.23-9.78). Similarly, the case-control data found an increased risk of intussusception following the first dose (OR: 8.45, 95% CI: 4.08-17.50) and following all doses (OR: 1.59, 95% CI: 1.11-2.27).
CONCLUSIONS: Findings of this meta-analysis suggest that the rotavirus vaccine is associated with an increased risk on the development of intussusception, principally seen after administration of the first dose of vaccine.”

RotaTeq vaccine adverse events and policy considerations.
“RESULTS: From February 3, 2021 through July 31, 2007, a total of 160 (of the 165 reported) intussusception and 11 (of the 16 reported) Kawasaki disease adverse event reports were identified when RotaTeq was administered or co-administered with other vaccines. Time-trend analyses showed that there were significant increases in the total number of intussusception and Kawasaki disease adverse events entered into VAERS in comparison to previous years.
CONCLUSIONS: These observations, coupled with limited rotavirus disease burden, cost-effectiveness, and potential contact viral transmission concerns, raise serious questions regarding the use of RotaTeq in the US. Healthcare providers should diligently report adverse events following RotaTeq vaccination to VAERS, and those who have experienced a vaccine-associated adverse event should be made aware that they may be eligible for compensation from the no-fault National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP).”

Sibling transmission of vaccine-derived rotavirus (RotaTeq) associated with rotavirus gastroenteritis.
“Although rotavirus vaccines are known to be shed in stools, transmission of vaccine-derived virus to unvaccinated contacts resulting in symptomatic rotavirus gastroenteritis has not been reported to our knowledge. We document here the occurrence of vaccine-derived rotavirus (RotaTeq [Merck and Co, Whitehouse Station, NJ]) transmission from a vaccinated infant to an older, unvaccinated sibling, resulting in symptomatic rotavirus gastroenteritis that required emergency department care.”

                                ð Adverse effect versus quality control of the Fuenzalida-Palacios antirabies vaccine.
“We evaluated the components of the Fuenzalida-Palacios antirabies vaccine, which is till used in most developing countries in human immunization for treatment and prophylaxis. This vaccine is prepared from newborn mouse brains at 1% concentration. Even though the vaccine is considered to have a low myelin content, it is not fully free of myelin or of other undesirable components that might trigger adverse effects after vaccination. The most severe effect is a post-vaccination neuroparalytic accident associated with Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome. In the present study we demonstrate how the vaccines produced and distributed by different laboratories show different component patterns with different degrees of impurity and with varying protein concentrations, indicating that production processes can vary from one laboratory to another. These differences, which could be resolved using a better quality control process, may affect and impair immunization, with consequent risks and adverse effects after vaccination. We used crossed immunoelectrophoresis to evaluate and demonstrate the possibility of quality control in vaccine production, reducing the risk factors possibly involved in these immunizing products.”

[A case of Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome following cholera vaccination (authorâs transl)].
“A 45-year-old woman developed bilateral ascending flaccid paralysis after cholera vaccination, 15 days after the first and 1 day after the second injection. The clinical course resulted in nearly complete paralysis of the lower limbs, paresis of the upper limbs and partial involvement of the cranial nerves. There was only slight sensory loss. The CSF revealed no pleocytosis and a protein level of 206 mg/100 ml. Recovery began 2 weeks later and was almost complete after 2 months. Immunological investigations revealed no remarkable changes.”

ð Demyelinating disease and polyvalent human papilloma virus vaccination
“Since its inception, the polyvalent vaccine against the human papilloma virus (HPV), Gardasil, has generated some controversies as a temporal relationship between the administrations of the vaccine and the development of a few autoimmune diseases, such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), multiple sclerosis (MS) and GuillainâBarre syndrome have been reported.1â3 We encountered two cases whose initial presentation of CNS demyelination followed in close time relationship the administration of Gardasil vaccine and we discuss their possible association.
Case No 1
A 19-year-old woman received two doses of Gardasil, 3 months apart, and approximately 1 month after the second dose, she developed numbness to the right foot that within 1 day extended to the contralateral foot and was associated with mid-thoracic back pain. Her neurological examination was only significant for the altered perception to touch to the feet. Deep tendon reflexes were normal and plantar reflexes in flexion. MRI of cervical and thoracic spine revealed a total of three lesions with characteristic demyelinating appearance, one of those in the thoracic spine was contrast-enhancing (figure 1AâC). MRI brain demonstrated one additional white matter lesion also consistent with a demyelinating process.”

[Demyelinating disease and vaccination of the human papillomavirus].
“CASE REPORTS: We describe the cases of four young women that developed demyelinating disease after the vaccination of the HPV, with a rank of time between the administration of the dose and the development of the clinical of seven days to a month, with similar symptoms with the successive doses. We have described six episodes coinciding after the vaccination.
CONCLUSIONS: Have been described seizures, autoimmune disorders such as Guillain-Barre syndrome, transverse myelitis, or motor neuron disease, probably adverse effects following immunization by HPV vaccine. So we suggest that vaccine may trigger an immunological mechanism leading to demyelinating events, perhaps in predisposed young.”

ð Guillain-BarrÃ© Syndrome after H1N1 Shot in Pregnancy: Maternal and Fetal Care in the Third Trimester-Case Report.
“We presented a case of a 36-year-old pregnant woman that was immunized to H1N1 in the last trimester; 10 days later she developed shoulder and lumbar spineâs pain, limbs weakness and facial paralysis with unfavorable clinical evolution and was submitted to intensive therapy care. We described clinical and obstetrical approach, pointing out peculiarities involved in this pathology in pregnancy.”

Guillain-Barre syndrome after influenza vaccine administration: two adult cases.
“We describe two adult cases of neurologic complications occurring after the administration of the influenza vaccine. The first case described is a 68 year-old man who experienced paresthesias of the upper and lower extremities two weeks after vaccination, and the second case was a 64 year-old female who exhibited paraplegia eighteen days after vaccination. Diagnosis of acute idiopathic demyelinating polyradiculopathy (Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome) was made for both patients, and intravenous gammaglobulin therapy was given with marked improvement of the first case, but poor response on the second case. Although the efficacy of influenza vaccination has been widely accepted, such neurologic complications might occur in the elderly and adult population. Even if Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome was a true side effect of vaccination, the risk is substantially lower than is the risk for complications following influenza. The rare occurrence of neurological complications after influenza vaccine should not discourage against the vaccination.”

Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome after vaccination in United States: data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/Food and Drug Administration Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (1990-2005).
“There were 1000 cases (mean age, 47 years) of GBS reported after vaccination in the United States between 1990 and 2005. The onset of GBS was within 6 weeks in 774 cases, &gt;6 weeks in 101, and unknown in 125. Death and disability after the event occurred in 32 (3.2%) and 167 (16.7%) subjects, respectively. The highest number (n = 632) of GBS cases was observed in subjects receiving influenza vaccine followed by hepatitis B vaccine (n = 94). Other vaccines or combinations of vaccines were associated with 274 cases of GBS. The incidence of GBS after influenza vaccination was marginally higher in subjects or=65 years (P = 0.09); for hepatitis vaccine, the incidence was significantly higher (P &lt; 0.0001) in the or=65 years compared with those &lt;65 years (P &lt; 0.0001).&quot;

Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome among recipients of Menactra meningococcal conjugate vaccine-United States, June-July 2005.
“Case Reports
Case 1. A male aged 18 years was vaccinated with MCV4; 15 days later, he experienced tingling in his feet and hands. He had no history of major underlying illness; his mother had had GBS 5 years earlier. He reported no history of respiratory or gastrointestinal illnesses during the 6 weeks before onset of symptoms. Sixteen days after vaccination, he was hospitalized, and nerve conduction studies (NCS) of upper and lower extremities, 2 days after onset of symptoms, were consistent with GBS. He was observed for 3 days, discharged, and then readmitted 2 days later with bilateral facial weakness and increasing lower extremity weakness. Patellar, triceps, and biceps deep tendon reflexes (DTRs) were absent. NCS performed 4 days after the previous examination revealed worsening motor nerve conduction velocities consistent with GBS. Tests for mononucleosis and Lyme disease were negative. During hospitalization, he was treated with plasmapheresis. His facial palsy and gait improved, and his reflexes returned. He was discharged home.
Case 2. A male aged 17 years was vaccinated with MCV4; approximately 25 days later, he had difficulty walking, followed by difficulty moving from a standing to a seated position. Medical history included attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and Asperger syndrome; he had been taking multiple psychotropic medications. He did not report recent respiratory or gastrointestinal illness. Thirty-two days after vaccination, he was hospitalized with bilateral muscle weakness of upper and lower extremities with absent DTRs. NCS was consistent with GBS. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed 2 white blood cells (WBC)/mm3 with protein of 60 mg/dL; bacterial cultures were negative. DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for adenovirus, herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, varicella zoster virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and RNA PCR for West Nile virus, eastern equine encephalitis virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, enterovirus, and California group and Cache Valley viruses, were all negative. During hospitalization, he was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). On discharge, his motor strength and gait were improved.
Case 3. A female aged 17 years was vaccinated with MCV4. She had a previous history of GBS at ages 2 and 5 years, both beginning 14 days after vaccination with childhood vaccines. She had not been previously vaccinated with meningococcal vaccine. Both episodes of GBS were characterized by muscle weakness, decreased reflexes, and difficulty walking. During both episodes, she was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin and completely recovered. Fourteen days after vaccination with MCV4, she reported numbness of toes and tongue and had a lump in her throat. These symptoms were followed by numbness of thighs and fingertips, arm weakness, inability to run, difficulty walking, and falling. Sixteen days after vaccination, she was hospitalized, and neurologic examination revealed decreased tone and weakness of both arms and legs and reflexes reduced or absent in ankles, knees, and arms. CSF results revealed 0 WBC/mm3 and protein 26 mg/dL. She was treated with IVIG, recovered, and discharged home.
Case 4. A female aged 18 years was vaccinated with MCV4. Six days after vaccination, she had a sore throat that lasted for 6 days, and 29 days after vaccination she reported a severe headache and was evaluated in an emergency department (ED), where she had a normal computerized tomography (CT) scan, was treated with ketorolac, and discharged on oral ibuprofen. Thirty-one days after vaccination, the patient reported numbness of legs and had trouble standing on her toes. The next morning she could not stand. The patient was admitted to the hospital, and physical examination revealed decreased muscle strength in ankles and wrists bilaterally and reduced biceps, knee, and ankle DTRs. Previous medical history included mild ulcerative colitis that had been asymptomatic off medications; she did not report having diarrhea during the 6 weeks before onset of muscle weakness. Her only outpatient medications were oral contraceptives. CSF analysis revealed 1 WBC/mm3 and a protein concentration of 30 mg/dL. NCS was consistent with GBS. She was treated with IVIG. After a 7-day hospitalization, her motor strength had improved, and she was discharged home with outpatient physical therapy. Three weeks after discharge, her weakness and gait were improved.
Case 5. A female aged 18 years was vaccinated with MCV4; 14 days later, she experienced heaviness in her legs when walking upstairs. During the next 8 days, her difficulty walking continued, and she had bilateral leg pain. Subsequently, she reported headache, back and neck pain, vomiting, and tingling in both hands. She became unable to walk and was evaluated in an ED, where an initial diagnosis of viral meningitis was made. Two days later, she was hospitalized for progressive weakness and inability to walk. Neurologic examination revealed bilateral acute flaccid weakness with decreased DTRs.”

Guillain - Barreâ syndrome following recombinant hepatitis B vaccine and literature review.
“A 17 year-old woman developed progressive quadriparesis with bilateral facial diplegia after immunization with recombinant hepatitis B vaccine 3 days prior. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed acellular fluid with high protein level. The electrodiagnosis was compatible with demyelinating polyneuropathy. Other potential causes of Guillain-Barreâ syndrome (GBS) were ruled out. Her motor power gradually improved and returned to normal later. The temporal relationship between GBS and vaccination was suggestive of a vaccine-induced cause. Mechanisms of this very rare complication are proposed with a literature review.”

Guillain-Barre syndrome occurring after rabies vaccination.
“A variety of events are associated with the onset of Guillain-Barre syndrome, including vaccinations and vaccines. These are the swine influenza vaccine, oral poliovirus vaccine and rabies vaccine. Rabies is a uniformly fatal disease. It is preventable if World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for post exposure treatment (PET) are followed. These include local treatment of wound, passive immunization with rabies immunoglobulins and administration of a efficacious vaccine. Cell culture vaccines are highly immunogenic with fewer side effects, but are costly. For that reason neurotissue vaccines are still widely used in Pakistan, although they are less immunogenic with higher incidence of neuroparalytic complications. We report a case of Guillain-Barre syndrome secondary to sheep brain anti-rabies vaccine in a young boy, who presented with lower limb weakness with total recovery after treatment.”

Recurrent Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome following influenza vaccine.
“Two patients recovered from an attack of Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome and then had a second attack of this disease, with a shorter latent period, following monovalent influenza vaccination. These cases suggest that an attack of Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome may result in greater risk of future episodes of the syndrome in conjunction with exposure to influenza or other vaccinations.”

Simultaneous development of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome associated with H1N1 09 influenza vaccination.
“A 36-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of urinary retention and muscle weakness affecting all 4 limbs after receiving a H1N1 09 influenza vaccination. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated multiple lesions in his brain and spinal cord. Furthermore, nerve conduction study showed acute sensorimotor neuropathy, and anti-GM2 antibodies were detected in his serum. Based on the temporal association and exclusion of alternative etiologies, we made a diagnosis of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) and Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome (GBS). To our knowledge, this is the first case of co-morbid ADEM and GBS after influenza vaccination with positive anti-ganglioside antibodies.”

Sudden hearing loss after rabies vaccination.
“BACKGROUND: Sudden hearing loss developing after immunisation is a very rare situation. Rabies is a viral disease characterised by encephalitis and death. Treatment involves active and passive immunisation. Neurologic complications including Guillain-Barre syndrome or facial paralysis are reported in the literature as a side effect after rabies immunisation.
CASE REPORT: Sudden hearing loss was detected in an 11 year-old male patient who had taken the medication for rabies immunisation.
CONCLUSION: This study presents a case report of sudden hearing loss developing after rabies immunisation - no other aetiological factors were detected and clinical management is discussed in light of the literature.”

Fibromyalgia, infection and vaccination: two more parts in the etiological puzzle.
“As the pathogenesis of fibromyalgia continues to raise debate, multiple putative triggers have been implicated. The current review summarizes the available data linking fibromyalgia to either infection or vaccination. Multiple infectious agents have been associated with the development of either full-blown fibromyalgia (e.g. hepatits C), or with symptom complexes extensively overlapping with that syndrome (e.g. chronic Lyme disease). The cases of Lyme disease, mycoplasma, hepatits C and HIV are detailed. Despite the described associations, no evidence is available demonstrating the utility of antibiotic or anti-viral treatment in the management of fibromyalgia. Possible mechanistic links between fibromyalgia and HIV are reviewed. Associations have been described between various vaccinations and symptom complexes including fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome. The case of Gulf War syndrome, a functional multisystem entity sharing many clinical characteristics with fibromyalgia is discussed, with emphasis on the possibility of association with administration of multiple vaccinations during deployment in the Persian Gulf and the interaction with stress and trauma. Based on this example a model is proposed, wherein vaccinations function as co-triggers for the development of functional disorders including fibromyalgia, in conjunction with additional contributing factors.”

Gulf war syndrome: could it be triggered by biological warfare-vaccines using pertussis as an adjuvant?
“Several recent epidemiological studies have shown that vaccinations against biological warfare using pertussis as an adjuvant were associated with the Gulf war syndrome. If such epidemiological findings are confirmed, we propose that the use of pertussis as an adjuvant could trigger neurodegeneration through induction of interleukin-1beta secretion in the brain. In turn, neuronal lesions may be sustained by stress or neurotoxic chemical combinations. Particular susceptibility for IL-1beta secretion and potential distant neuronal damage could provide an explanation for the diversity of the symptoms observed on veterans.”

Acute Onset of Parkinsonism With Reversible Course After H1N1 Vaccination: Insight From a Young Lady
“To the Editor: Parkinsonian symptoms can be induced by acute encephalitis, syphilis, malaria, poliomyelitis, and sudden carbon monoxide poisoning.1,2 In this report, a 17-year-old girl had Parkinsonâs disease (PD) symptoms after a flu shot. So far, this is the first vaccine-related disorder that mimics PD. Our experience has shown that some parkinsonism can be cured with accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.”

Encephalitis related to a H1N1 vaccination: case report and review of the literature.
“RESULTS: We report a case of a 26-year-old female who developed symptoms of acute encephalitis 5 days after vaccination against the pandemic 2009 A/H1N1 influenza. MRI of the brain showed confluent T2-hyperintense signal intensity changes in the deep white matter which further confirmed the diagnosis of encephalitis/acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Despite therapy with immunoglobulins and corticosteroids, her persistent vegetative state continued. In light of the dramatic cause of this case, we reviewed all 21 other previously reported cases of central nervous system demyelination related to H1N1 vaccination and/or infection.
CONCLUSIONS: The available data suggest that even severe central nervous system demyelination i.e. acute encephalitis/disseminated encephalomyelitis and transverse myelitis may very rarely be associated with vaccination against novel influenza A/H1N1 or with A/H1N1 infection itself.”

Ischaemic stroke and influenza A H1N1 vaccination: a case report.
“We report a 75-year-old male patient who suffered posterior circulation ischaemia after influenza A/H1N1 vaccination. Vaccination provokes a variable magnitude of inflammatory and immunological response that modifies the risk for ischaemic stroke. Whereas a causal relation between vaccination and ischaemic stroke is still unsettled, an inflammatory/immunological response after vaccination may trigger thrombosis superimposing a pre-existing prothrombotic state. Careful monitoring is strongly suggested for individuals who received H1N1 vaccine, especially those with high ischaemic stroke risk.”

Simultaneous development of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome associated with H1N1 09 influenza vaccination.
“A 36-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of urinary retention and muscle weakness affecting all 4 limbs after receiving a H1N1 09 influenza vaccination. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated multiple lesions in his brain and spinal cord. Furthermore, nerve conduction study showed acute sensorimotor neuropathy, and anti-GM2 antibodies were detected in his serum. Based on the temporal association and exclusion of alternative etiologies, we made a diagnosis of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) and Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome (GBS). To our knowledge, this is the first case of co-morbid ADEM and GBS after influenza vaccination with positive anti-ganglioside antibodies.”

Alopecia Areata After Vaccination: Recurrence with Rechallenge.
“Alopecia areata (AA) is the most common form of hair loss in children. We report the case of a child who had two episodes of AA after two different vaccines with complete hair regrowth between the episodes. This case supports the concept that vaccination might be a trigger for the development of AA in genetically predisposed children.”

Hair loss after routine immunizations.
“A total of 60 evaluable reports submitted since 1984 and coded for “alopecia” after immunizations included 16 with positive rechallenge (hair loss after vaccination on more than 1 occasion), 4 of which were definite and 12 possible or probable. Of the 60 cases, 46 had received hepatitis B vaccines. Both of the currently available recombinant products, as well as the former plasma-derived product, were represented. Females predominated in all age groups. The majority of patients recovered, but clinical features, such as intervals from vaccination until onset and the extent and reversibility of hair loss, varied widely. Nine patients reported previous medication allergy.”

ð Telogen effluvium following bivalent human papillomavirus vaccine administration: a report of two cases.
“We describe two cases of telogen effluvium occurring in two 11-year-old children following bivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine administration. The two children began to lose their hair following the second HPV vaccine dose. Alopecia worsened following the third vaccine dose and then resolved spontaneously within a few months. In both cases, laboratory analysis and psychiatric evaluation excluded causes other than anti-HPV vaccine. Social discomfort and isolation were associated with alopecia in the two children. The clinical presentation was consistent with a pattern of telogen effluvium. The identification of specific vaccine components responsible for triggering the adverse event remains difficult. In similar cases, suspension of immunization is not recommended, as it provides health benefits that overcome the possible adverse effect of transient telogen effluvium. Caregivers should ensure psychiatric support to their patients to manage the social and emotional distress that might be associated with hair loss.”

                                Epidemic of complicated mumps in previously vaccinated young adults in the South-West of France. 2014.
“Five cases of meningitis, 1 of orchitis, and 1 of unilateral hearing impairment were identified. Each of the 7 patients had been previously vaccinated with MMR, 4 had received 2 doses of this vaccine.” 
“Outbreaks of complicated mumps may still occur despite a broad coverage of MMR vaccination.”

Reports of sensorineural deafness after measles, mumps, and rubella immunisation.
“There have been nine reports of sensorineural hearing loss after measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) immunisation. In three cases the deafness was unrelated to MMR immunisation. In six cases the cause was unknown and MMR remained a possible aetiology. Any risk associated with attenuated viruses must be weighed against the risks of the natural diseases.”

Sudden hearing loss after rabies vaccination.
“BACKGROUND: Sudden hearing loss developing after immunisation is a very rare situation. Rabies is a viral disease characterised by encephalitis and death. Treatment involves active and passive immunisation. Neurologic complications including Guillain-Barre syndrome or facial paralysis are reported in the literature as a side effect after rabies immunisation.
CASE REPORT: Sudden hearing loss was detected in an 11 year-old male patient who had taken the medication for rabies immunisation.
CONCLUSION: This study presents a case report of sudden hearing loss developing after rabies immunisation - no other aetiological factors were detected and clinical management is discussed in light of the literature.”

Sudden onset unilateral sensorineural hearing loss after rabies vaccination.
“A 33-year-old man developed profound sudden onset right-sided hearing loss with tinnitus and vertigo, within 24 h of pretravel rabies vaccination. There was no history of upper respiratory tract infection, systemic illness, ototoxic medication or trauma, and normal otoscopic examination. Pure tone audiograms (PTA) demonstrated right-sided sensorineural hearing loss (thresholds 90-100 dB) and normal left-sided hearing. MRI internal acoustic meatus, viral serology (hepatitis B, C, HIV and cytomegalovirus) and syphilis screen were normal. Positive Epstein-Barr virus IgG, viral capsid IgG and anticochlear antibodies (anti-HSP-70) were noted. Initial treatment involved a course of high-dose oral prednisolone and acyclovir. Repeat PTAs after 12 days of treatment showed a small improvement in hearing thresholds. Salvage intratympanic steroid injections were attempted but failed to improve hearing further. Sudden onset sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) is an uncommon but frightening experience for patients. This is the first report of SSNHL following rabies immunisation in an adult.”

                                🛑 Assessment of iatrogenic transmission of HCV in Southern Italy: was the cause the Salk polio vaccination?
“Since the first studies on hepatitis C virus (HCV) prevalence were published, it has been evident that southern Italy is an area of hyperendemicity. A recent study conducted in southern Italy suggested that the high prevalence of HCV infection might be the result of past iatrogenic transmission. Polio vaccination with the parenteral Salk vaccine between 1956 and 1965 by multiple use of unsafe glass syringes may have been one of the major causes of the spread of HCV infection among southern Italian adults who are now older than 40 years of age. Persons born between the 1940s and early 1960s have a nearly 3-fold increased risk of HCV seropositivity than the younger age group. The findings are consistent with a cohort effect of exposure to the Salk parenteral vaccination.”

🛑 The cost of unsafe injections.
“Unsafe injection practices are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly from hepatitis B and C and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections.”
“Annually more than 1.3 million deaths and US$ 535 million are estimated to be due to current unsafe injection practices. With the global increase in the number of injections for vaccination and medical services, safer injecting technologies such as auto-disable syringes must be budgeted for.”

The injection century: massive unsterile injections and the emergence of human pathogens.
“Unsterile medical injections are common in the less-developed world, where most visits to a doctor result in the (generally unnecessary) administration of intramuscular, or subcutaneous drugs. WHO estimates1 that every year unsafe injections result in 80 000–160 000 new HIV-1 infections, 8·16 million hepatitis B infections, and 2·3–4·7 million hepatitis C infections worldwide (this figure does not include transfusions). Together, these illnesses account for 1·3 million deaths and 23 million years of lost life.”

🛑 Injection Safety Practice among Health Workers in Static Immunisation Centres in an Urban Community of Nigeria.
“However, reports have it that about one-third of immunisation injections are unsafe in many countries of the world including Africa.” 
“The common infections associated with unsafe injection listed by the subjects were abscess, HIV and Hepatitis in that order of frequency.”
“Re-use of syringe for vaccine withdrawal and re-capping of used needles before discard were common practices observed while accidental needle stick injury was reported by about half (49%) of the subjects.”

Mortality and morbidity among military personnel and civilians during the 1930s and World War II from transmission of hepatitis during yellow fever vaccination: systematic review.
“During World War II, nearly all US and Allied troops received yellow fever vaccine. Until May 1942, it was both grown and suspended in human serum. In April 1942, major epidemics of hepatitis occurred in US and Allied troops who had received yellow fever vaccine. A rapid and thorough investigation by the US surgeon general followed, and a directive was issued discontinuing the use of human serum in vaccine production. The large number of cases of hepatitis caused by the administration of this vaccine could have been avoided. Had authorities undertaken a thorough review of the literature, they would have discovered published reports, as early as 1885, of postvaccination epidemics of hepatitis in both men and horses. It would take 4 additional decades of experiments and epidemiological research before viruses of hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E were identified, their modes of transmission understood, and their genomes sequenced.”

The XIX century smallpox prevention in Naples and the risk of transmission of human blood-related pathogens.
“Although Galbiati established the retro-vaccination (1803) and developed the “calf” lymph vaccine, recognized and implemented since 1864 as the optimal smallpox vaccine in the following hundred years, Naples general population was mainly vaccinated with “human” lymph from abandoned children until 1893. Mini-epidemics of syphilis and serum hepatitis were periodically reported as results of arm-to-arm procedure. The risk of transmission of blood-related pathogens was higher in Naples where &gt;80% of abandoned children, used as repository of cowpox virus, were dying in their first year of life.”

ð [Vaccines, biotechnology and their connection with induced abortion].
“Diploid cells (WI-38, MRC-5) vaccines have their origin in induced abortions. Among these vaccines we fi nd the following: rubella, measles, mumps, rabies, polio, smallpox, hepatitis A, chickenpox, and herpes zoster. Nowadays, other abortion tainted vaccines cultivated on transformed cells (293, PER.C6) are in the pipeline: flu, Respiratory Syncytial and parainfluenza viruses, HIV, West Nile virus, Ebola, Marburg and Lassa, hepatitis B and C, foot and mouth disease, Japanese encephalitis, dengue, tuberculosis, anthrax, plague, tetanus and malaria. The same method is used for the production of monoclonal antibodies and other proteins, gene therapy and genomics. Technology enables us to develop the aforementioned products without resorting to induced abortion. Full disclosure of the cell origin in the labelling of vaccines and other products must be supported. There are vaccines from non-objectionable sources which should be made available to the public. When no alternative vaccines exist, ethical research must be promoted. Non-objectionable sources in the production of monoclonal antibodies, gene therapy and genomics must be encouraged. It is not be consistent to abstain from products originated in embryonic stem cells and at the same time approve of products obtained from induced abortions. It is of paramount importance to avoid that induced abortion technology seeps into every field of Medicine.”

                                Absence of antibodies to HTLV-III in health workers after hepatitis B vaccination.
“A proportion of the plasma for the triply inactivated, plasma-derived hepatitis B vaccine produced in the United States is obtained from homosexual men. Because homosexual men are a high-risk group for the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), concern has emerged that the vaccine could harbor the AIDS agent.”

Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis following Vaccination against Hepatitis B in a Child: A Case Report and Literature Review
“Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, which has been associated with several vaccines such as rabies, diphtheria-tetanus-polio, smallpox, measles, mumps, rubella, Japanese B encephalitis, pertussis, influenza, and the Hog vaccine. Here, we presented a case of 12-year-old child who suffered from ADEM three weeks after hepatitis B vaccination. He was admitted to our hospital with symptoms of weakness of limbs, high fever, and alteration of consciousness. Some abnormalities were also found in CSF. Treatment with high-dose corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin had significant effect, with marked improvement of the clinical symptoms and the results of CSF. The findings of MRI also detected some abnormal lesions located in both brain and spinal cord. The clinical features, the findings of CSF and MRI, and therapeutic effect may contribute to such diagnosis of ADEM.”

ð Adverse events associated with childhood vaccines other than pertussis and rubella. Summary of a report from the Institute of Medicine.Â 
The committee found that the evidence favored acceptance of a causal relation between diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome and brachial neuritis, between measles vaccine and anaphylaxis, between oral polio vaccine and Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome, and between unconjugated Hib vaccine and susceptibility to Hib disease. The committee found that the evidence established causality between diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and anaphylaxis, between measles vaccine and death from measles vaccine-strain viral infection, between measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and thrombocytopenia and anaphylaxis, between oral polio vaccine and poliomyelitis and death from polio vaccine-strain viral infection, and between hepatitis B vaccine and anaphylaxis.

Anetoderma occurring after hepatitis B vaccination.
“Anetoderma is an elastolytic disorder of unknown origin. To our knowledge, anetoderma secondary to hepatitis B immunization has been described only once in the literature, in two siblings vaccinated at the same time. We describe, what we believe to be an additional case of such a rare disorder in a 21-year-old man. He presented with white spots and papules on his neck, upper limbs and trunk, that had developed gradually within the last 6 years without any symptoms. The initial lesions were red macules, which gradually enlarged in size and number, becoming pale. Biopsy of a sack-like lesion revealed normal epidermis and a discrete mononuclear infiltrate throughout the dermis. Association of anetoderma with hepatitis B vaccination is speculated here, as suggested by history of vaccination two weeks prior to the onset of skin eruption and ruling out other possible causes of anetoderma.”

Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome after vaccination in United States: data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/Food and Drug Administration Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (1990-2005).
“There were 1000 cases (mean age, 47 years) of GBS reported after vaccination in the United States between 1990 and 2005. The onset of GBS was within 6 weeks in 774 cases, &gt;6 weeks in 101, and unknown in 125. Death and disability after the event occurred in 32 (3.2%) and 167 (16.7%) subjects, respectively. The highest number (n = 632) of GBS cases was observed in subjects receiving influenza vaccine followed by hepatitis B vaccine (n = 94). Other vaccines or combinations of vaccines were associated with 274 cases of GBS. The incidence of GBS after influenza vaccination was marginally higher in subjects or=65 years (P = 0.09); for hepatitis vaccine, the incidence was significantly higher (P &lt; 0.0001) in the or=65 years compared with those &lt;65 years (P &lt; 0.0001).&quot;

Guillain - Barreâ syndrome following recombinant hepatitis B vaccine and literature review.
“A 17 year-old woman developed progressive quadriparesis with bilateral facial diplegia after immunization with recombinant hepatitis B vaccine 3 days prior. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed acellular fluid with high protein level. The electrodiagnosis was compatible with demyelinating polyneuropathy. Other potential causes of Guillain-Barreâ syndrome (GBS) were ruled out. Her motor power gradually improved and returned to normal later. The temporal relationship between GBS and vaccination was suggestive of a vaccine-induced cause. Mechanisms of this very rare complication are proposed with a literature review.”

Hair loss after routine immunizations.
“A total of 60 evaluable reports submitted since 1984 and coded for “alopecia” after immunizations included 16 with positive rechallenge (hair loss after vaccination on more than 1 occasion), 4 of which were definite and 12 possible or probable. Of the 60 cases, 46 had received hepatitis B vaccines. Both of the currently available recombinant products, as well as the former plasma-derived product, were represented. Females predominated in all age groups. The majority of patients recovered, but clinical features, such as intervals from vaccination until onset and the extent and reversibility of hair loss, varied widely. Nine patients reported previous medication allergy.”

? Hepatitis B Vaccinesâto Switch or Not to Switch
“Shortly after the licensure of Heptavax-B in 1981 and its general availability in July 1982, the discovery of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) among male homosexuals threatened the success of this product, since some of the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive plasma donors were members of this high-risk group. Intensive epidemiologic, virological, and serological evaluations were launched, which eventually found no evidence for the transmission of AIDS to recipients of the plasma-derived HBsAg vaccine.”

The injection century: massive unsterile injections and the emergence of human pathogens.
“Unsterile medical injections are common in the less-developed world, where most visits to a doctor result in the (generally unnecessary) administration of intramuscular, or subcutaneous drugs. WHO estimates1 that every year unsafe injections result in 80 000â160 000 new HIV-1 infections, 8Â·16 million hepatitis B infections, and 2Â·3â4Â·7 million hepatitis C infections worldwide (this figure does not include transfusions). Together, these illnesses account for 1Â·3 million deaths and 23 million years of lost life.”

Multiple sclerosis and hepatitis B vaccination: could minute contamination of the vaccine by partial hepatitis B virus polymerase play a role through molecular mimicry?
“Reports of multiple sclerosis developing after hepatitis B vaccination have led to the concern that this vaccine might be a cause of multiple sclerosis in previously healthy subjects. Some articles evidenced that minor Hepatitis B virus (HBV) polymerase proteins could be produced by alternative transcriptional or translational strategies. Their detection is very difficult because they are in minute concentration and probably enzymatically inactive, however, it was shown that they could be exposed on the outside of the virus particles and also be immunogenic. In addition, HBV polymerase shares significant amino acid similarities with the human myelin basic protein. We hypothesise that some of the apparent adverse reactions to the vaccine could be due to a process called of molecular mimicry, the HBV polymerase, which could be a contaminant in the recombinant or plasma-derived vaccines, could act as autoantigens and induce autoimmune demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis.”

“RESULTS: Of 1771 neonatal reports, there were 18 deaths in 8 boys and 9 girls (1 patient unclassified). The mean age at vaccination for these 18 cases was 12 days (range, 1-27 days); median time from vaccination to onset of symptoms was 2 days (range, 0-20 days); and median time from symptoms to death was 0 days (range, 0-15 days). The mean birth weight of the neonates (n = 15) was 3034 g (range, 1828-4678 g). The causes of death for the 17 autopsied cases were sudden infant death syndrome for 12, infection for 3, and 1 case each of intracerebral hemorrhage, accidental suffocation, and congenital heart disease.”

ð Polio, hepatitis B and AIDS: an integrative theory on a possible vaccine induced pandemic.
“The hypothesis that simian virus 40 (SV40) infected polio vaccines may be linked to the evolution of acquired immunodeficiency disorder (AIDS), and certain cancers, has been advanced. Most recently, investigators discussed the likelihood of gene-reshuffling following SV40 infection as a precursor to acquired immune dysfunction. Findings of recent SV40 infections in four children born after 1982 suggest infections were transmitted vertically along gene lines. Earlier observations proved activation of a retrovirus gene by a hepatitis B virus (HBV) protein. This paper proposes a new integrative theory on the origin of AIDS. It advances the possibility of genetic recombinations with oncogene activation by HBV involving simian viruses that likely infected polio vaccinated blood donors to the initial hepatitis B (HB) vaccine trials conducted on gay men in New York City and Ugandan Blacks in the early to mid-1970s. The socio-economic and even military ramifications associated with this politically challenging thesis are discussed.”

“Studies suggest a relationship between exposure to endocrine disrupters, such as mercury (Hg), and premature puberty. Hg exposure from Thimerosal-containing hepatitis B vaccine, administered at specific intervals within the first six months of life, and the childâs long-term risk of being diagnosed with premature puberty (ICD-9 code: 259.1), was retrospectively examined, using a hypothesis-testing, longitudinal case-control design on prospectively collected data, in the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD). Cases diagnosed with premature puberty were significantly more likely to have received increased exposure to Hg from hepatitis B vaccines preserved with Thimerosal given in the first month after birth (odds ratio (OR) = 1.803), first two months after birth (OR = 1.768), and first six months after birth (OR = 2.0955), compared to control subjects. When the data were separated by gender, the effects remained among females but not males. Female cases, as compared to female controls, were significantly more likely in a dose-dependent manner to have received a greater exposure to Hg from hepatitis B vaccines preserved with Thimerosal, given in the first six months after birth (OR = 1.0281 per Âµg Hg). The results of this study show a dose-dependent association between increasing organic Hg exposure from Thimerosal-containing hepatitis B vaccines administered within the first six months of life and the long-term risk of the child being diagnosed with premature puberty.”

The Risk of AIDS After Hepatitis Vaccination
“In the recent decision analysis article by Sacks et al1 in the Dec 28, 1984, issue of The Journal, the authors claim to have calculated the maximum rate of hepatitis B vaccine-induced acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) to be eight per 100,000 with 95% confidence. This calculation is based on a study of 40,000 persons who had been vaccinated prior to mid-1982. I do not believe that an extrapolation from this population can be expected to hold true for a vaccine manufactured from todayâs pool of donors.”

Should the risk of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome deter hepatitis B vaccination? A decision analysis.
“The current epidemic of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and fear that its causative agent contaminates the currently available hepatitis B vaccine may have deterred vaccine use. We formulated a decision-analytic model that compares the risk of death from hepatitis B and AIDS in those vaccinated with the risk of death from hepatitis B alone in those who wait two years for a synthetic vaccine. For individuals with 5% annual risk of hepatitis B, the best current estimate is that vaccination now would save 25 lives per 100,000. The best current estimate of the rate of vaccine-induced AIDS is zero, and one can be 95% confident that the rate is less than eight per 100,000. The rate would have to be considerably higher before postponement of vaccination would be rational for those for whom vaccination has been recommended.”

Status epilepticus and lymphocytic pneumonitis following hepatitis B vaccination.
“The case reported refers to a patient who developed status epilepticus in the day of her third dose of hepatitis B vaccination and we review the literature on this subject. A 12 year-old girl, without a relevant previous history, taking no drugs, developed a seizure attack followed by unconsciousness, and eventually died after three days of her third dose of hepatitis B (HB) vaccination. Autopsy study revealed cerebral edema with congestion and herniation and diffuse interstitial type pneumonitis. There seem to be a straight forward time relationship between the third HB vaccine, the event of convulsion and the sudden death of the patient. We suggest that, in some cases, vaccination may be the triggering factor for autoimmune and neurological disturbances in genetically predisposed individuals and physicians should be aware of this possible association.”

                                ð Beta-tryptase and quantitative mast-cell increase in a sudden infant death following hexavalent immunization.
“A fatal case of a 3-month-old female infant, who died within 24 h of vaccination with hexavalent vaccine is presented. Clinical data, post-mortem findings (acute pulmonary oedema, acute pulmonary emphysema), quali-quantitative data collected from immunohistochemical staining (degranulating mast cells) and laboratory analysis with a high level of beta-tryptase in serum, 43.3 microg/l, allows us to conclude that acute respiratory failure likely due to post hexavalent immunization-related shock was the cause of death.”

Hypotonic-hyporesponsive episodes after administration of hexavalent DTP-based combination vaccine: A description of 12 cases. (2017) 
“Hypotonic-hyporesponsive (HHE) episodes are known and recognized phenomena, which typically occur within 48 hours of immunisation..Our aim is to describe 12 cases of HHE brought to the Center of Pediatric Sleep Medicine, with attention to the clinical features of the episode and their follow-up. Medical charts of infants visited between 2005-2015 were reviewed. Twelve infants showed a HHE using HHE using Brighton Collaboration Criteria. All infants received a Hexavalent diphtheria -tetanus -pertussis acellular component -hepatitis B-,inactivated poliovirus- Haemophilus influenzae type-b conjugate vaccine. Five out of 12 were brought to Emergency Department, where 2 were symptomatic (one was hyporeactive, the other had fever). No infant died during the episode, or the follow-up, nor developed neurological disease after subsequent vaccinations. HHE are confirmed as benign events, even after administration of hexavalent vaccination, devoid of negative neuropsychomotor outcome.”

ð Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) shortly after hexavalent vaccination: another pathology in suspected SIDS?
“Herein we report the case of a 3-month-old female infant dying suddenly and unexpectedly shortly after being given a hexavalent vaccination. Examination of the brainstem on serial sections revealed bilateral hypoplasia of the arcuate nucleus. The cardiac conduction system presented persistent fetal dispersion and resorptive degeneration. This case offers a unique insight into the possible role of hexavalent vaccine in triggering a lethal outcome in a vulnerable baby. Any case of sudden unexpected death occurring perinatally and in infancy, especially soon after a vaccination, should always undergo a full necropsy study according to our guidelines.”

                                ð Adverse events associated with childhood vaccines other than pertussis and rubella. Summary of a report from the Institute of Medicine.
“The committee found that the evidence favored acceptance of a causal relation between diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome and brachial neuritis, between measles vaccine and anaphylaxis, between oral polio vaccine and Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome, and between unconjugated Hib vaccine and susceptibility to Hib disease. The committee found that the evidence established causality between diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and anaphylaxis, between measles vaccine and death from measles vaccine-strain viral infection, between measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and thrombocytopenia and anaphylaxis, between oral polio vaccine and poliomyelitis and death from polio vaccine-strain viral infection, and between hepatitis B vaccine and anaphylaxis.”

Adverse events following Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccines in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, 1990-2013.
“Includes 29 747 reports after Hib vaccines; 5179 (17%) were serious, including 896 reports of deaths. Median age was 6 months (range 0-1022 months). Sudden infant death syndrome was the stated cause of death in 384 (51%) of 749 death reports with autopsy/death certificate records.”

Adverse events following vaccination in premature infants.
“Apparent adverse events were noted in 17 of 45 (37.8%) babies: 9 (20%) had major events, i.e. apnoea, bradycardia or desaturations, and 8 (17.8%) had minor events, i.e. increased oxygen requirements, temperature instability, poor handling and feed intolerance. Babies with major events were significantly younger (p &lt; 0.05), had a lower postmenstrual age (p &lt; 0.05) and weighed less (p &lt; 0.05) at the time of vaccination compared with babies without major events.&quot; 
&quot;CONCLUSION: Vaccine-related cardiorespiratory events are relatively common in preterm babies. Problems were much more common if vaccine is administered at or before 70 d. These babies should therefore be monitored postvaccination.&quot;

Haemophilus influenzae Type b Meningitis in the Short Period after Vaccination: A Reminder of the Phenomenon of Apparent Vaccine Failure.
“We present two cases of bacterial meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) which developed a few days after conjugate Hib vaccination. This phenomenon of postimmunization provocative time period is reviewed and discussed. These cases serve as a reminder to clinicians of the risk, albeit rare, of invasive Hib disease in the short period after successful immunization.”

ð Hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode in a 7-month-old infant after receipt of multiple vaccinations.
“A 7-month-old boy became difficult to arouse, was limp and had blue extremities 8 hours after immunization with intravenous poliovirus, diphtheria-tetanus toxoids-acellular pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae type b-hepatitis B virus and pneumococcal vaccines. The hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode had resolved by the time the infant was seen in an emergency department 1 hour later. The report describes hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode, encourages reporting of vaccine-associated adverse events and discusses prognosis and implications for subsequent immunization.”

Origins of and solutions for neonatal medication-dispensing errors.
“In 2008, there were five cases in which look-alike or sound-alike neonatal medication-dispensing errors occurred at our institution. A mix-up between neonatal and adult or pediatric products occurred in four of the five cases. Three of the five errors resulted in near misses with the potential to cause harm. The other two errors reached the patients but did not cause harm. The medication mix-ups involved adult and neonatal phytonadione injectable emulsion, sodium citrate injection and vancomycin-heparin combination injection, adult tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis and infant diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccines, Haemophilus B and DTaP vaccines, and cisatracurium and vecuronium.”

Severe apnoeas following immunisation in premature infants.
“Four premature infants developed apnoeas severe enough to warrant resuscitation after immunisation with diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus (DPT), and Haemophilus influenzae B (Hib). One required re-intubation and ventilation. Although apnoeas after immunisation are recognised, they are not well documented. It is time for further research to elucidate the best time to immunise such infants.”

Human Leukocyte Antigens
“The HLA gene family provides instructions for making a group of related proteins known as the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. The HLA complex helps the immune system distinguish the bodyâs own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders such as viruses and bacteria.”
“More than 100 diseases have been associated with different alleles of HLA genes.”

Autoimmune/auto-inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA) after quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccination in Colombians: a call for personalised medicine.
“This was a case study in which 3 patients with autoimmune/auto-inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA) after quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccination (HPV) were evaluated and described. All the patients were women. Diagnosis consisted of HLA-B27 enthesitis related arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematous, respectively. Our results highlight the risk of developing ASIA after HPV vaccination and may serve to increase the awareness of such a complication. Factors that are predictive of developing autoimmune diseases should be examined at the population level in order to establish preventive measures in at-risk individuals for whom healthcare should be personalized and participatory.”

Hypotonic and hyporesponsive episodes after diptheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccination.
“Administration of the discontinued diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus vaccine was occasionally associated with a hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode in infants. The whole bacterial cell pertussis component was the likely culprit. For this reason, an acellular pertussis component was developed and incorporated into a new vaccine commonly called diptheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTaP). Administration of DTaP vaccine has been followed by remarkably few hypotonic or hyporesponsive episodes. This report describes one of these unusual events.”

Hypotonic hyporesponsive episode and the 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine.
“Hypotensive-hyporesponsive episodes are rare events after immunizations performed for diphtheria, tetanus, Haemophilus influenzae type b and hepatitis B virus vaccines, but most of the reported episodes have been associated with pertussis-containing vaccines. We report the case of a 3-month-old girl, previously healthy otherwise, presenting with the unusual event of a hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode after vaccination with the 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine. Diagnosis was established after a thorough evaluation of the patient and by exclusion of other clinical conditions.”

🛑 Hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode in a 7-month-old infant after receipt of multiple vaccinations.
“A 7-month-old boy became difficult to arouse, was limp and had blue extremities 8 hours after immunization with intravenous poliovirus, diphtheria-tetanus toxoids-acellular pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae type b-hepatitis B virus and pneumococcal vaccines. The hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode had resolved by the time the infant was seen in an emergency department 1 hour later. The report describes hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode, encourages reporting of vaccine-associated adverse events and discusses prognosis and implications for subsequent immunization.”

Hypotonic-hyporesponsive episodes after administration of hexavalent DTP-based combination vaccine: A description of 12 cases. (2017) 
“Hypotonic-hyporesponsive (HHE) episodes are known and recognized phenomena, which typically occur within 48 hours of immunisation..Our aim is to describe 12 cases of HHE brought to the Center of Pediatric Sleep Medicine, with attention to the clinical features of the episode and their follow-up. Medical charts of infants visited between 2005-2015 were reviewed. Twelve infants showed a HHE using HHE using Brighton Collaboration Criteria. All infants received a Hexavalent diphtheria -tetanus -pertussis acellular component -hepatitis B-,inactivated poliovirus- Haemophilus influenzae type-b conjugate vaccine. Five out of 12 were brought to Emergency Department, where 2 were symptomatic (one was hyporeactive, the other had fever). No infant died during the episode, or the follow-up, nor developed neurological disease after subsequent vaccinations. HHE are confirmed as benign events, even after administration of hexavalent vaccination, devoid of negative neuropsychomotor outcome.”

Vaccine-related adverse events in Cuban children, 1999-2008.
“The DTwP vaccine exhibited the highest rate of adverse events. Common minor events were: fever (17,538), reactions at injection site (4470) and systemic side effects (2422). Rare events (by WHO definition) reported were: persistent crying (2666), hypotonic-hyporesponsive episodes (3), encephalopathy (2) and febrile seizures (112). Severe events included: anaphylaxis (2), respiratory distress (1), multiple organ failure (1), sudden death (1), vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (2), toxic shock syndrome (3), and sepsis (1). The 10 deaths and 3 cases of disability were investigated by an expert commission, which concluded that 8 of the 13 severe events were vaccination-related.”

A case of Evansâ syndrome following influenza vaccine.
“CASE REPORT: A 50-year-old man with no prior medical history developed Evansâ syndrome 4 days after receiving influenza immunization. The patient improved following treatment with oral prednisone and intravenous immunoglobulin.
CONCLUSION: Influenza vaccine is one of the most commonly used vaccines worldwide, with millions of people being vaccinated annually. Despite its wide use, only sparse information has been published concerning any hematological effects of this vaccine. The rarity of such effects supports the safety of using this vaccine.”

[Demyelinating disease and vaccination of the human papillomavirus].
“CASE REPORTS: We describe the cases of four young women that developed demyelinating disease after the vaccination of the HPV, with a rank of time between the administration of the dose and the development of the clinical of seven days to a month, with similar symptoms with the successive doses. We have described six episodes coinciding after the vaccination.
CONCLUSIONS: Have been described seizures, autoimmune disorders such as Guillain-Barre syndrome, transverse myelitis, or motor neuron disease, probably adverse effects following immunization by HPV vaccine. So we suggest that vaccine may trigger an immunological mechanism leading to demyelinating events, perhaps in predisposed young.”

Gastrointestinal immunopathology and food allergy.
“In contrast to the beneficial expressions of gastrointestinal-associated lymphoid tissue, which are seen with relevance to newer methods of delivery of vaccines directly applied to the gastrointestinal mucosal surfaces (eg, oral poliovirus, rotavirus, Salmonella typhi vaccines), the adverse consequences of a mucosal immune response gone astray are evidenced in many diseases such as FA. A classification of clinical disorders associated with FA based on classic mechanisms of immunologic injury is presented, which includes the following: (1) IgE-mediated, (2) non-IgE-mediated, and (3) mixed IgE- and non-IgE-mediated disorders. Our study of immunologic disturbance in patients with non-IgE FA revealed a pattern of increased CD4+ and decreased TH1 cell counts in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in contrast to patients with celiac disease, where a pattern of increased CD8+ and TH1 cell counts in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and increased CD8+ cell counts was seen.”

Mumps vaccine associated orchitis: Evidence supporting a potential immune-mediated mechanism. 
“We report 3 cases of orchitis following vaccination with mumps-measles-rubella (MMR) vaccine, two with an onset within 3 days following vaccination. Orchitis is a common complication of mumps infection, particularly in post-pubertal males, and is also recognized as a very rare complication of mumps vaccination. These cases, discussed together with a comprehensive review of the existing literature regarding post-vaccine orchitis, highlight uncertainty regarding the pathogenesis of post-vaccine orchitis.”

ð A possible central mechanism in autism spectrum disorders, part 1.
“The autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of related neurodevelopmental disorders that have been increasing in incidence since the 1980s. Despite a considerable amount of data being collected from cases, a central mechanism has not been offered. A careful review of ASD cases discloses a number of events that adhere to an immunoexcitotoxic mechanism. This mechanism explains the link between excessive vaccination, use of aluminum and ethylmercury as vaccine adjuvants, food allergies, gut dysbiosis, and abnormal formation of the developing brain. It has now been shown that chronic microglial activation is present in autistic brains from age 5 years to age 44 years. A considerable amount of evidence, both experimental and clinical, indicates that repeated microglial activation can initiate priming of the microglia and that subsequent stimulation can produce an exaggerated microglial response that can be prolonged. It is also known that one phenotypic form of microglia activation can result in an outpouring of neurotoxic levels of the excitotoxins, glutamate and quinolinic acid. Studies have shown that careful control of brain glutamate levels is essential to brain pathway development and that excesses can result in arrest of neural migration, as well as dendritic and synaptic loss. It has also been shown that certain cytokines, such as TNF-alpha, can, via its receptor, interact with glutamate receptors to enhance the neurotoxic reaction. To describe this interaction I have coined the term immunoexcitotoxicity, which is described in this article.”

Vaccinations and secondary immune thrombocytopenia with antiphospholipid antibodies by human papillomavirus vaccine.
“A 13-year-old girl developed immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and concomitant positive antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) following vaccination with a quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. During the course of a disease, she developed clinical manifestation with bleeding and she was treated with intravenous immunoglobulins. Consequently, the number of her platelets remained critically low and she was put on corticosteroids and rituximab. Since then, her platelet count remain within the normal range, but her aPL are still present.

                                Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis After Influenza Vaccination: A Case Report
“Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis developed in a 42-year-old woman within 3 weeks of receiving the seasonal influenza vaccine. She had 80% recovery after 3 months of treatment with methylprednisolone. Although cases of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis after vaccination for influenza are rare, enough of them have occurred that critical care nurses should be aware of the possibility. Early treatment can prevent serious residual signs and symptoms; therefore, correct and quick diagnosis is important. Medical history obtained from patients with central nervous system problems should include history of recent vaccinations.”

Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis following inactivated influenza vaccination in the Brazilian Amazon: a case report
“Here, we describe a case of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) that occurred during a plausible risk interval following inactivated influenza vaccination in a previously healthy 27-year-old man from Manaus, Brazil. He was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone and immunoglobulin. One-month follow-up revealed resolution of the brain lesions, but not of the spinal cord lesions. No recurrence or progression of the main neurological symptoms was observed. After two years of monitoring, the patient continues to experience weak lower limbs and urinary retention. Thus, we recommend that ADEM should be considered in a patient presenting with neurological symptoms after influenza vaccination.”

Acute Onset of Parkinsonism With Reversible Course After H1N1 Vaccination: Insight From a Young Lady
“To the Editor: Parkinsonian symptoms can be induced by acute encephalitis, syphilis, malaria, poliomyelitis, and sudden carbon monoxide poisoning.1,2 In this report, a 17-year-old girl had Parkinsonâs disease (PD) symptoms after a flu shot. So far, this is the first vaccine-related disorder that mimics PD. Our experience has shown that some parkinsonism can be cured with accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.”

ð Are toxic biometals destroying your childrenâs future?
“Cadmium, arsenic, lead, and mercury have been linked to autism, attention deficit disorder, mental retardation and death of children. Mercury in thimerosal found in many vaccines and flu shots contributes significantly to these problems. Decomposition of the thimerosal can produce more toxic compounds, either methylethylmercury or diethylmercury, in the body. These compounds have a toxicity level similar to dimethylmercury. Within the human body, a mitochondrial disorder may release the more toxic form of mercury internally. Young children and pregnant women must minimize internal exposure to the vaccines and flu shots containing mercury.”

A case of Evansâ syndrome following influenza vaccine.
“CASE REPORT: A 50-year-old man with no prior medical history developed Evansâ syndrome 4 days after receiving influenza immunization. The patient improved following treatment with oral prednisone and intravenous immunoglobulin.
CONCLUSION: Influenza vaccine is one of the most commonly used vaccines worldwide, with millions of people being vaccinated annually. Despite its wide use, only sparse information has been published concerning any hematological effects of this vaccine. The rarity of such effects supports the safety of using this vaccine.”

Deaths Reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, United States,1997-2013.
“RESULTS: VAERS received 2149 death reports, most (n = 1469 [68.4%]) in children. Median age was 0.5 years (range, 0-100 years); males accounted for 1226 (57%) reports. The total annual number of death reports generally decreased during the latter part of the study period. Most common causes of death among 1244 child reports with available death certificates/autopsy reports included sudden infant death syndrome (n = 544 [44%]), asphyxia (n = 74 [6.0%]), septicemia (n = 61 [4.9%]), and pneumonia (n = 57 [4.6%]). Among 526 adult reports, most common causes of death included diseases of the circulatory (n = 247 [46.9%]) and respiratory systems (n = 77 [14.6%]), certain infections and parasitic diseases (n = 62 [11.8%]), and malignant neoplasms (n = 20 [3.8%]). For child death reports, 79.4% received &gt;1 vaccine on the same day. Inactivated influenza vaccine given alone was most commonly associated with death reports in adults (51.4%).”

Encephalitis related to a H1N1 vaccination: case report and review of the literature.
“RESULTS: We report a case of a 26-year-old female who developed symptoms of acute encephalitis 5 days after vaccination against the pandemic 2009 A/H1N1 influenza. MRI of the brain showed confluent T2-hyperintense signal intensity changes in the deep white matter which further confirmed the diagnosis of encephalitis/acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Despite therapy with immunoglobulins and corticosteroids, her persistent vegetative state continued. In light of the dramatic cause of this case, we reviewed all 21 other previously reported cases of central nervous system demyelination related to H1N1 vaccination and/or infection.
CONCLUSIONS: The available data suggest that even severe central nervous system demyelination i.e. acute encephalitis/disseminated encephalomyelitis and transverse myelitis may very rarely be associated with vaccination against novel influenza A/H1N1 or with A/H1N1 infection itself.”

Exacerbation of pemphigus after influenza vaccination.
“Pemphigus is a rare autoimmune disease characterized by flaccid blisters and erosions on skin and mucous epithelia. A critical event in its pathogenesis is production of antidesmoglein antibodies, which mediate the loss of intercellular adhesion in epithelia, leading to blister formation. Multiple environmental factors (ultraviolet radiation, trauma, drugs, infective agents) have been suggested as possible triggers of pemphigus. Occasionally, the disease has been reported to follow viral and bacterial vaccination. We describe a patient who experienced exacerbation of pemphigus shortly after administration of the influenza vaccination on two separate occasions. We review the literature, suggest possible explanations for a causal relationship, and discuss the administration of vaccination to these patients.”

Guillain-Barre syndrome after influenza vaccine administration: two adult cases.
“We describe two adult cases of neurologic complications occurring after the administration of the influenza vaccine. The first case described is a 68 year-old man who experienced paresthesias of the upper and lower extremities two weeks after vaccination, and the second case was a 64 year-old female who exhibited paraplegia eighteen days after vaccination. Diagnosis of acute idiopathic demyelinating polyradiculopathy (Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome) was made for both patients, and intravenous gammaglobulin therapy was given with marked improvement of the first case, but poor response on the second case. Although the efficacy of influenza vaccination has been widely accepted, such neurologic complications might occur in the elderly and adult population. Even if Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome was a true side effect of vaccination, the risk is substantially lower than is the risk for complications following influenza. The rare occurrence of neurological complications after influenza vaccine should not discourage against the vaccination.”

Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome after vaccination in United States: data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/Food and Drug Administration Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (1990-2005).
“There were 1000 cases (mean age, 47 years) of GBS reported after vaccination in the United States between 1990 and 2005. The onset of GBS was within 6 weeks in 774 cases, &gt;6 weeks in 101, and unknown in 125. Death and disability after the event occurred in 32 (3.2%) and 167 (16.7%) subjects, respectively. The highest number (n = 632) of GBS cases was observed in subjects receiving influenza vaccine followed by hepatitis B vaccine (n = 94). Other vaccines or combinations of vaccines were associated with 274 cases of GBS. The incidence of GBS after influenza vaccination was marginally higher in subjects or=65 years (P = 0.09); for hepatitis vaccine, the incidence was significantly higher (P &lt; 0.0001) in the or=65 years compared with those &lt;65 years (P &lt; 0.0001).&quot;

Guillain-Barre syndrome occurring after rabies vaccination.
“A variety of events are associated with the onset of Guillain-Barre syndrome, including vaccinations and vaccines. These are the swine influenza vaccine, oral poliovirus vaccine and rabies vaccine. Rabies is a uniformly fatal disease. It is preventable if World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for post exposure treatment (PET) are followed. These include local treatment of wound, passive immunization with rabies immunoglobulins and administration of a efficacious vaccine. Cell culture vaccines are highly immunogenic with fewer side effects, but are costly. For that reason neurotissue vaccines are still widely used in Pakistan, although they are less immunogenic with higher incidence of neuroparalytic complications. We report a case of Guillain-Barre syndrome secondary to sheep brain anti-rabies vaccine in a young boy, who presented with lower limb weakness with total recovery after treatment.”

Ischaemic stroke and influenza A H1N1 vaccination: a case report.
“We report a 75-year-old male patient who suffered posterior circulation ischaemia after influenza A/H1N1 vaccination. Vaccination provokes a variable magnitude of inflammatory and immunological response that modifies the risk for ischaemic stroke. Whereas a causal relation between vaccination and ischaemic stroke is still unsettled, an inflammatory/immunological response after vaccination may trigger thrombosis superimposing a pre-existing prothrombotic state. Careful monitoring is strongly suggested for individuals who received H1N1 vaccine, especially those with high ischaemic stroke risk.”

Potential risk of repeated nasal vaccination that induces allergic reaction with mucosal IgE and airway eosinophilic infiltration in cynomolgus macaques infected with H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus.
“On the other hand, eosinophil clusters were observed in the lungs of vaccinated macaques. Although Vac-3-specific IgE antibody and IL-13 levels were decreased after infection compared to those before infection and no anaphylaxis in vaccinated macaques was detected after challenge infection, our results suggest that we have to pay attention to potential allergic responses at repeated nasal vaccination, especially in people who have an airway allergy.”

ð Recurrence of Panic Attacks after Influenza Vaccination: Two Case Reports.Â 
“We present two cases of panic disorder patients whose symptoms were aggravated by the influenza vaccination. We assumed that dysregulation of T-lymphocytes in panic disorder patients could have a role in activating various kinds of cytokines and chemokines, which then can lead to panic attack aggravation.”

[Recurrent encephalitis following annual influenza vaccine. Case report].
“Influenza vaccine is rarely associated with neurological adverse effects such as Guillain BarrÃ© syndrome, encephalitis or aseptic meningitis. We report the case of a male patient that presented two episodes of acute encephalitis in consecutive years, 16 and 20 days after his annual influenza vaccine shot, respectively. In both instances, patient required ICU admission and evolved with fast recovery and no sequels. The first episode was managed empirically as herpetic encephalitis but an extensive study was performed in the second episode without identifying any microorganism. Neuroimaging studies also discarded acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Mild pleocytosis of mononuclear predominance was detected in both cases in CSF. Naranjo score punctuated 8 points indicating a probable causal relationship. Acute encephalitis is a rare adverse effect of influenza vaccine and occurs several days after immunization. It has a broad differential diagnosis, and appears to be of self-limited duration and associated with good prognosis.”

Recurrent Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome following influenza vaccine.
“Two patients recovered from an attack of Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome and then had a second attack of this disease, with a shorter latent period, following monovalent influenza vaccination. These cases suggest that an attack of Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome may result in greater risk of future episodes of the syndrome in conjunction with exposure to influenza or other vaccinations.”

Severe manifestations of autoimmune syndrome induced by adjuvants (Shoenfeldâs syndrome).
“From 2011 to 2016, we identified 4479 ASIA cases, of them 305 fulfilled arbitrary criteria of severe ASIA including our case presentation and 11 deaths. The majority of severe ASIA cases were related to HPV vaccine, silicone, influenza vaccine and mineral oil injections. The interval from exposition to severe manifestation was from 2 days to 23 years. (1) This is the first study that analyzes all cases published on ASIA with severe manifestations. (2) The current HPV vaccine is both effective and generally safe. However, it should be noted that severe autoimmune side effects have been reported in several studies. Severe ASIA may be observed after influenza vaccines, and other vaccines. (3) Efforts should be made to discover the connection between adjuvants, autoimmunity and autoimmune diseases, because there is an increase in cases severe and life-threatening of ASIA.”

Simultaneous development of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome associated with H1N1 09 influenza vaccination.
“A 36-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of urinary retention and muscle weakness affecting all 4 limbs after receiving a H1N1 09 influenza vaccination. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated multiple lesions in his brain and spinal cord. Furthermore, nerve conduction study showed acute sensorimotor neuropathy, and anti-GM2 antibodies were detected in his serum. Based on the temporal association and exclusion of alternative etiologies, we made a diagnosis of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) and Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome (GBS). To our knowledge, this is the first case of co-morbid ADEM and GBS after influenza vaccination with positive anti-ganglioside antibodies.”

                                Bacillus Calmette-Guérin reactivation as a sign of incomplete Kawasaki disease.
“An early and specific clinical sign, not included in the classical diagnosis criteria, but that can be very useful in the diagnosis of KD, is the reaction at the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) inoculation site. We describe a case of a 4-month-old boy, fully immunised, whose BCG scar reactivation led to the diagnosis of IKD. This case-report emphasises the importance of BCG site reactivation in establishing a diagnosis of IKD that clinicians should be aware of, especially in countries where BCG vaccination is still part of the immunisation schedule.

“The known association between hepatitis B and vasculitis has been reported in rare cases in adults after hepatitis B vaccination. We here describe a 35-day-old infant who developed Kawasaki disease 1 day after receiving his second dose of hepatitis B vaccine. Although extremely rare, this possible side effect should be noted and further investigated.”

[Reactivation of the scar of BCG vaccination in Kawasaki’s disease: clinical case and literature review].
“Kawasaki disease is an acute febrile multisystemic vasculitis affecting children that can affect the coronary arteries. Routine BCG vaccination in Mexico leads to a 99% coverage in infants younger than 1 year. We present a case of Kawasaki disease with skin lesions at the site of BCG. Clinicians should be aware of this clinical manifestation that could help diagnose atypical or incomplete cases of the disease.”

RotaTeq vaccine adverse events and policy considerations.
“RESULTS: From February 3, 2021 through July 31, 2007, a total of 160 (of the 165 reported) intussusception and 11 (of the 16 reported) Kawasaki disease adverse event reports were identified when RotaTeq was administered or co-administered with other vaccines. Time-trend analyses showed that there were significant increases in the total number of intussusception and Kawasaki disease adverse events entered into VAERS in comparison to previous years.
CONCLUSIONS: These observations, coupled with limited rotavirus disease burden, cost-effectiveness, and potential contact viral transmission concerns, raise serious questions regarding the use of RotaTeq in the US. Healthcare providers should diligently report adverse events following RotaTeq vaccination to VAERS, and those who have experienced a vaccine-associated adverse event should be made aware that they may be eligible for compensation from the no-fault National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP).”

Two infants with tuberculid associated with Kawasaki disease.
“The adverse events of BCG vaccination, including local reactions, lymphadenitis, osteomyelitis, tuberculid, and disseminated infection, have been reported. Two infants presented erythema at the inoculation site of BCG after the resolution of Kawasaki disease (KD). They received BCG vaccination 1 week and 6 weeks before the KD onset, respectively. Intravenous immunoglobulin improved the KD activity, however the skin rash of BCG inoculation site extended to the face and extremities days 24 and 10 after the KD onset, respectively. Both bacteriological study and interferon-γ release assay were negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. These patients were diagnosed as having tuberculid after KD.”

An ulcerated lesion at the BCG vaccination site during the course of Kawasaki disease.
“We describe a bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) granuloma that occurred during the course of Kawasaki disease. A 12-month-old male infant with Kawasaki disease had an erythematous indurated plaque with prominent necrotic ulceration at the BCG vaccination site on the left upper arm. Histologic study showed a granulomatous reaction consisting of epithelioid histiocytes, lymphoid cells, and Langhans-type giant cells. No evidence of mycobacterial infection was obtained. The lesion healed completely within 2 weeks without administration of antituberculous agents. We believe that the granulomatous reaction occurred as a result of hypersensitivity to proteins in the BCG vaccine, which appeared after the onset of Kawasaki disease.”

                                Borderline tuberculoid leprosy following BCG vaccination. A case report.
“Borderline tuberculoid leprosy was diagnosed clinically and histologically in a four year-old boy about 6 months after intradermal vaccination with BCG. His mother reported that a lesion began to appear above the vaccination site on the arm 2 weeks after the vaccination, and a second lesion appeared on the chin 2 months later. Responses in the lymphocyte transformation test to sonicated Mycobacterium leprae, BCG, and to PPD were consistent with a tuberculoid leprosy infection. Precipitation of BT leprosy by intradermal BCG infection may possibly represent the overcoming of a phase of primary suppression in an individual who might otherwise have progressed toward lepromatous leprosy. The implications of this hypothesis for the planning of a controlled trial of an anti-leprosy vaccine are discussed.”

                                ð Assessment of iatrogenic transmission of HCV in Southern Italy: was the cause the Salk polio vaccination?
“Since the first studies on hepatitis C virus (HCV) prevalence were published, it has been evident that southern Italy is an area of hyperendemicity. A recent study conducted in southern Italy suggested that the high prevalence of HCV infection might be the result of past iatrogenic transmission. Polio vaccination with the parenteral Salk vaccine between 1956 and 1965 by multiple use of unsafe glass syringes may have been one of the major causes of the spread of HCV infection among southern Italian adults who are now older than 40 years of age. Persons born between the 1940s and early 1960s have a nearly 3-fold increased risk of HCV seropositivity than the younger age group. The findings are consistent with a cohort effect of exposure to the Salk parenteral vaccination.”

The XIX century smallpox prevention in Naples and the risk of transmission of human blood-related pathogens.
“Although Galbiati established the retro-vaccination (1803) and developed the “calf” lymph vaccine, recognized and implemented since 1864 as the optimal smallpox vaccine in the following hundred years, Naples general population was mainly vaccinated with “human” lymph from abandoned children until 1893. Mini-epidemics of syphilis and serum hepatitis were periodically reported as results of arm-to-arm procedure. The risk of transmission of blood-related pathogens was higher in Naples where &gt;80% of abandoned children, used as repository of cowpox virus, were dying in their first year of life.”

                                Adjuvants- and vaccines-induced autoimmunity: animal models.
“In some cases, adjuvants may trigger generalized autoimmune response, resulting in multiple auto-antibodies, but sometimes they can reproduce human autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren syndrome, autoimmune thyroiditis and antiphospholipid syndrome and may provide insights about the potential adverse effects of adjuvants.”

Autoimmune/auto-inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA) after quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccination in Colombians: a call for personalised medicine.
“This was a case study in which 3 patients with autoimmune/auto-inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA) after quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccination (HPV) were evaluated and described. All the patients were women. Diagnosis consisted of HLA-B27 enthesitis related arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematous, respectively. Our results highlight the risk of developing ASIA after HPV vaccination and may serve to increase the awareness of such a complication. Factors that are predictive of developing autoimmune diseases should be examined at the population level in order to establish preventive measures in at-risk individuals for whom healthcare should be personalized and participatory.”

A case-control study of quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine-associated autoimmune adverse events.
“It was observed that cases with the SAAE outcomes of gastroenteritis (odds ratio (OR) = 4.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.3-18.5), arthritis (OR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.4-4.3), systemic lupus erythematosus (OR = 5.3, 95% CI = 1.5-20.5), vasculitis (OR = 4, 95% CI = 1.01-16.4), alopecia (OR = 8.3, 95% CI = 4.5-15.9), or CNS conditions (OR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.04-2.9) were significantly more likely than controls to have received HPV4 vaccine (median onset of SAAE symptoms from 6 to 55 days post-HPV4 vaccination).”

A case of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) following Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination.
“A 15-year-old young woman received the Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines. Following the second HPV vaccination, intermittent fever, myalgia, arthritis and malar rash developed, and she was admitted to our hospital. Laboratory studies showed positive results for antinuclear antibody, anti-dsDNA antibody and anti-Sm antibody. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was diagnosed according to the Systemic Lupus International Collaborative Clinics 2012. Magnetic resonance imaging showed abnormal hyperintense areas in the fascia, and en bloc biopsy showed fasciitis. Treatment with prednisolone resulted in an amelioration of the symptoms. Reportedly, SLE developed after HPV vaccinations in some patients. Most such patients have a past or family history of autoimmune disease and presented SLE symptoms after the second vaccination. We describe herein a patient in whom SLE developed in association with HPV vaccination.”

Vaccinations and risk of systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
(2017)
“The pooled findings suggested that vaccinations significantly increased risk of SLE (RR=1.50; 95%CI 1.05-2.12, P=0.02). In addition, there was an obvious association between vaccinations and increased risk of RA (RR=1.32; 95%CI 1.09-1.60, P=0.004). Meta-analysis of studies reporting outcomes of short vaccinated time also suggested that vaccinations could significantly increase risk of SLE (RR=1.93; 95%CI 1.07-3.48, P=0.028) and RA (RR=1.48; 95%CI 1.08-2.03, P=0.015).”

                                ð Lyme disease and autism
Incorrect testing methods for Lyme disease and other tick-borne illnesses are currently being used. Vaccines trigger latent infections, which are commonly passed on in utero. 
Divergent opinions of proper Lyme disease diagnosis and implications for children co-morbid with autism spectrum disorder.
“This paper proposes that some children with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the United States have undiagnosed Lyme disease and different testing criteria used by commercial laboratories may be producing false negative results. Two testing protocols will be evaluated; first, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) approved two-tiered Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) or Immunofluorescence Assay (IFA) followed by an IgM and/or IgG Western Blot test. Second, a clinical diagnosis (flu like symptoms, joint pain, fatigue, neurological symptoms, etc.) possibly followed by a Western Blot with a broader criteria for positive bands [1]. The hypothesis proposes that the former criteria may be producing false negative results for some individuals diagnosed with an ASD. Through an online survey parents of 48 children who have a diagnosis of an ASD and have been diagnosed with Lyme disease were asked to fill out the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC) before they started antibiotic therapy and after treatment. Of the 48 parents surveyed 45 of them (94%) indicated their child initially tested negative using the two-tiered CDC/IDSA approved test. The parents sought a second physician who diagnosed their child with Lyme disease using the wider range of Western Blot bands. The children were treated with antibiotics and their scores on the ATEC improved. Anecdotal data indicated that some of the children achieved previously unattained developmental milestones after antibiotic therapy began. Protein bands OSP-A and/or OSP-B (Western Blot band 31) and (Western Blot band 34) were found in 44 of 48 patients. These two bands are so specific to Borrelia burgdorferi that they were targeted for use in vaccine trials, yet are not included in the IDSA interpretation of the Western Blot.”

Occurrence of severe destructive lyme arthritis in hamsters vaccinated with outer surface protein A and challenged with Borrelia burgdorferi.
“When the canine rOspA vaccine was combined with aluminum hydroxide, all vaccinated hamsters developed arthritis after challenge with B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. Histopathologic examination confirmed the development of severe destructive arthritis in rOspA-vaccinated hamsters challenged with B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. These findings suggest that rOspA vaccines should be modified to eliminate epitopes of OspA responsible for the induction of arthritis. Our results are important because an rOspA vaccine in aluminum hydroxide was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in humans.”

Biopersistence and Brain Translocation of Aluminum Adjuvants of Vaccines
Concerns about the use of aluminum adjuvants have emerged following (i) recognition of their role at the origin of the so-called macrophagic myofasciitis (MMF) lesion in 2001 (3, 4), which revealed fundamental misconception of their adjuvant effect and pointed out their unexpectedly long-lasting biopersistence (4); and (ii) demonstration of their apparent capacity to migrate in lymphoid organs and then disseminate throughout the body within monocyte-lineage cells and progressively accumulate in the brain (5).

Macrophagic myofasciitis associated with vaccine-derived aluminium.
“Macrophagic myofasciitis is characterised by sheets of macrophages in striated muscle, a few lymphocytes and inconspicuous muscle fibre damage. It is due to aluminium contained in vaccines, and is localised to the inoculation site. We report the first Australian case, detected incidentally when investigating a raised serum creatine kinase level.”

“The committee found that the evidence favored acceptance of a causal relation between diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome and brachial neuritis, between measles vaccine and anaphylaxis, between oral polio vaccine and Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome, and between unconjugated Hib vaccine and susceptibility to Hib disease. The committee found that the evidence established causality between diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and anaphylaxis, between measles vaccine and death from measles vaccine-strain viral infection, between measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and thrombocytopenia and anaphylaxis, between oral polio vaccine and poliomyelitis and death from polio vaccine-strain viral infection, and between hepatitis B vaccine and anaphylaxis.”

Anaphylaxis following single component measles and rubella immunisation.
“Anaphylaxis as an adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) is a rare occurrence. We report four cases of anaphylaxis following administration of single component measles or rubella vaccine between January 2003 and June 2007. We estimate that the incidence of anaphylaxis to measles and rubella single component vaccines is 18.9 and 22.4 cases/100,000 doses, respectively. These figures are likely to be an underestimate but are higher than expected. Our calculations were hampered by lack of immunisation reporting data from the private sector. We recommend that NHS standards of vaccine data reporting are also applied to private clinics.”

Beware of ‘lookalikesâ. (2017)
“In 2014, health staff who were vaccinating children in rebel-held northern Syria accidentally administered a muscle relaxant, atracurium, to up to 75 children, killing 15 of them. An investigation found that the drug was given to the children instead of a solution used to mix measles vaccines because the packaging was similar.”

Detection of measles vaccine in the throat of a vaccinated child.
“Measles vaccine is widely used, most often in association with mumps and rubella vaccines. We report here the case of a child presenting with fever 8 days after vaccination with a measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. Measles virus was isolated in a throat swab taken 4 days after fever onset. This virus was then further genetically characterised as a vaccine-type virus. Fever occurring subsequent to measles vaccination is related to the replication of the live attenuated vaccine virus. In the case presented here, the vaccine virus was isolated in the throat, showing that subcutaneous injection of an attenuated measles strain can result in respiratory excretion of this virus.”

Detection of measles virus RNA in urine specimens from vaccine recipients.
“Analysis of urine specimens by using reverse transcriptase-PCR was evaluated as a rapid assay to identify individuals infected with measles virus. For the study, daily urine samples were obtained from either 15-month-old children or young adults following measles immunization. Overall, measles virus RNA was detected in 10 of 12 children during the 2-week sampling period. In some cases, measles virus RNA was detected as early as 1 day or as late as 14 days after vaccination. Measles virus RNA was also detected in the urine samples from all four of the young adults between 1 and 13 days after vaccination. This assay will enable continued studies of the shedding and transmission of measles virus and, it is hoped, will provide a rapid means to identify measles infection, especially in mild or asymptomatic cases.”

Explosive school-based measles outbreak: intense exposure may have resulted in high risk, even among revaccinees.
“Even high levels of measles vaccination coverage have not always prevented outbreaks of measles spread by airborne transmission. It has been suggested that a large inoculum might increase vaccine failure risk. Airbome transmission might occasionally entail a large measles inoculum. The epidemiologic relevance of measles among properly vaccinated persons (i.e., those vaccinated after 15 months of age and with live attenuated virus) is increased when they become contagious. The authors studied inoculum intensities as measured by proxy variables and the contagiousness of properly vaccinated persons who contracted measles among 51 measles patients infected in one school, at home, or elsewhere, utilizing preexisting records of measles cases and 214 healthy controls from an explosive school outbreak that occurred in a rural Finnish municipality in 1989. One “super-spreader” infected 22 others in one day, including eight once-vaccinated students and one twice-vaccinated student, probably during an assembly of 144 students in a poorly ventilated hallway with no sunlight. Those infected later at home had high measles risk, even if they were revaccinees. When siblings shared a bedroom with a measles case, a 78 percent risk (seven out of nine children) was observed among vaccinees. Vaccinees had approximately 2 daysâ shorter incubation time than unvaccinated persons. Vaccinated and unvaccinated students were equally able to infect their siblings. Total protection against measles might not be achievable, even among revaccinees, when children are confronted with intense exposure to measles virus.”

Failure to reach the goal of measles elimination. Apparent paradox of measles infections in immunized persons.
“RESULTS: We found 18 reports of measles outbreaks in very highly immunized school populations where 71% to 99.8% of students were immunized against measles. Despite these high rates of immunization, 30% to 100% (mean, 77%) of all measles cases in these outbreaks occurred in previously immunized students. In our hypothetical school model, after more than 95% of schoolchildren are immunized against measles, the majority of measles cases occur in appropriately immunized children.
CONCLUSIONS: The apparent paradox is that as measles immunization rates rise to high levels in a population, measles becomes a disease of immunized persons. Because of the failure rate of the vaccine and the unique transmissibility of the measles virus, the currently available measles vaccine, used in a single-dose strategy, is unlikely to completely eliminate measles. The long-term success of a two-dose strategy to eliminate measles remains to be determined.”

Fatal adult respiratory distress syndrome in a scalded child after immunization with attenuated virus (measles, mumps and rubella).
“A fatal adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurred in a 15-month-old child who had suffered minor scalding during the febrile response to combined attenuated virus immunization (measles, mumps and rubella [MMR]). Despite vigorous efforts the child died 26 days after the accident. It is suggested that the scalding suppressed the normal immune response to the viremia and that the latter (i.e. most likely the measles viremia) caused the lung damage which, in turn, led to the ARDS.”

Is measles vaccination a risk factor for inflammatory bowel disease?
Thompson NP, et al. Lancet. 1995.
“Measles virus may persist in intestinal tissue, particularly that affected by Crohnâs disease, and early exposure to measles may be a risk factor for the development of Crohnâs disease. Crohnâs disease and ulcerative colitis occur in the same families and may share a common aetiology. In view of the rising incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (Crohnâs disease and ulcerative colitis), we examined the impact of measles vaccination upon these conditions. Prevalences of Crohnâs disease, ulcerative colitis, coeliac disease, and peptic ulceration were determined in 3545 people who had received live measles vaccine in 1964 as part of a measles vaccine trial. A longitudinal birth cohort of 11,407 subjects was one unvaccinated comparison cohort, and 2541 partners of those vaccinated was another. Compared with the birth cohort, the relative risk of developing Crohnâs disease in the vaccinated group was 3.01 (95% CI 1.45-6.23) and of developing ulcerative colitis was 2.53 (1.15-5.58). There was no significant difference between these two groups in coeliac disease prevalence. Increased prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease, but not coeliac disease or peptic ulceration, was found in the vaccinated cohort compared with their partners. These findings suggest that measles virus may play a part in the development not only of Crohnâs disease but also of ulcerative colitis.”

Measles inclusion-body encephalitis caused by the vaccine strain of measles virus.
“We report a case of measles inclusion-body encephalitis (MIBE) occurring in an apparently healthy 21-month-old boy 8.5 months after measles-mumps-rubella vaccination. He had no prior evidence of immune deficiency and no history of measles exposure or clinical disease. During hospitalization, a primary immunodeficiency characterized by a profoundly depressed CD8 cell count and dysgammaglobulinemia was demonstrated. A brain biopsy revealed histopathologic features consistent with MIBE, and measles antigens were detected by immunohistochemical staining. Electron microscopy revealed inclusions characteristic of paramyxovirus nucleocapsids within neurons, oligodendroglia, and astrocytes. The presence of measles virus in the brain tissue was confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The nucleotide sequence in the nucleoprotein and fusion gene regions was identical to that of the Moraten and Schwarz vaccine strains; the fusion gene differed from known genotype A wild-type viruses.”

Measles outbreak in a fully immunized secondary-school population.
“An outbreak of measles occurred among adolescents in Corpus Christi, Texas, in the spring of 1985, even though vaccination requirements for school attendance had been thoroughly enforced. Serum samples from 1806 students at two secondary schools were obtained eight days after the onset of the first case. Only 4.1 percent of these students (74 of 1806) lacked detectable antibody to measles according to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and more than 99 percent had records of vaccination with live measles vaccine. Stratified analysis showed that the number of doses of vaccine received was the most important predictor of antibody response. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals of seronegative rates were 0 to 3.3 percent for students who had received two prior doses of vaccine, as compared with 3.6 to 6.8 percent for students who had received only a single dose. After the survey, none of the 1732 seropositive students contracted measles. Fourteen of 74 seronegative students, all of whom had been vaccinated, contracted measles. In addition, three seronegative students seroconverted without experiencing any symptoms. We conclude that outbreaks of measles can occur in secondary schools, even when more than 99 percent of the students have been vaccinated and more than 95 percent are immune.”

“A measles outbreak occurred in Dhankutta town in year 2056 Falgun to 2057 Baishak (3 months). A total of 130 cases were registered at the Dhankutta District Hospital. A large proportion of the cases had severe disease with complications and were admitted at the hospital. None of the patients registered at the hospital died. Interestingly, 50.0% of cases were in higher age group (10 years and above) which is an unusual trend in developing countries. All the cases gave history of measles vaccination, which points towards the need for investigation of vaccine efficacy and cold chain efficiency.”

Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy and Adieâs pupil after measles vaccination.
“Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome is an increasingly recognized disorder with typical radiologic findings of bilateral gray- and white-matter abnormalities in the posterior regions of the cerebral hemispheres. The majority of patients with reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome are adults, and it is rare in children. Previously reported associations of reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome include hypertension, vasculitis, nephrotic syndrome, severe hypercalcemia, hemolytic uremic syndrome, eclampsia, renal failure, and use of immunosuppressive drugs. Adieâs pupil is described as the presence of a large unilateral or bilateral tonic pupil related to virus infections or trauma. In this article, we describe a case of reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy and Adieâs pupil association that occurred after measles vaccination. To our knowledge, this association has not been reported.”

Risk factors for measles vaccine failure among immunized students.
“An outbreak of measles occurred in a municipal school system which had reported 98% of students immunized against measles. A case-control study was conducted to determine reasons for vaccine failure. Vaccine failure was associated with immunizations that could not be documented in the providerâs records. Among children with provider-documented immunization, vaccine failure was associated with vaccination at 12 to 14 months of age with an odds ratio of 4.73. Among children vaccinated at 15 months or older, vaccine failure was not associated with time elapsed since vaccination. Studies should be conducted to determine whether unreliable immunization records are a more widespread problem. Further consideration should be given to routine revaccination of children previously vaccinated at 12 to 14 months of age.”

ð [Vaccines, biotechnology and their connection with induced abortion].
“Diploid cells (WI-38, MRC-5) vaccines have their origin in induced abortions. Among these vaccines we fi nd the following: rubella, measles, mumps, rabies, polio, smallpox, hepatitis A, chickenpox, and herpes zoster. Nowadays, other abortion tainted vaccines cultivated on transformed cells (293, PER.C6) are in the pipeline: flu, Respiratory Syncytial and parainfluenza viruses, HIV, West Nile virus, Ebola, Marburg and Lassa, hepatitis B and C, foot and mouth disease, Japanese encephalitis, dengue, tuberculosis, anthrax, plague, tetanus and malaria. The same method is used for the production of monoclonal antibodies and other proteins, gene therapy and genomics. Technology enables us to develop the aforementioned products without resorting to induced abortion. Full disclosure of the cell origin in the labelling of vaccines and other products must be supported. There are vaccines from non-objectionable sources which should be made available to the public. When no alternative vaccines exist, ethical research must be promoted. Non-objectionable sources in the production of monoclonal antibodies, gene therapy and genomics must be encouraged. It is not be consistent to abstain from products originated in embryonic stem cells and at the same time approve of products obtained from induced abortions. It is of paramount importance to avoid that induced abortion technology seeps into every field of Medicine.”

Haemophilus influenzae Type b Meningitis in the Short Period after Vaccination: A Reminder of the Phenomenon of Apparent Vaccine Failure.
“We present two cases of bacterial meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) which developed a few days after conjugate Hib vaccination. This phenomenon of postimmunization provocative time period is reviewed and discussed. These cases serve as a reminder to clinicians of the risk, albeit rare, of invasive Hib disease in the short period after successful immunization.”

Horizontal transmission of the Leningrad-Zagreb mumps vaccine strain: a report of six symptomatic cases of parotitis and one case of meningitis.
“Here we report horizontal symptomatic transmission of the Leningrad-Zagreb (L-Zagreb) mumps vaccine virus. Children who were the source of transmission had been vaccinated with the MMR vaccine (Serum Institute of India) contained L-Zagreb mumps virus. This is the first report of horizontal symptomatic transmission of this vaccine. The etiology of all seven contact cases was confirmed by epidemiological linking, serology and by F, SH, NP and HN mumps virus genes sequencing.”

A prefecture-wide survey of mumps meningitis associated with measles, mumps and rubella vaccine.
“A survey of untoward reactions, especially central nervous system reactions, after the administration of a newly introduced measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine in Gunma Prefecture, Japan, was initiated soon after 4 patients were hospitalized for aseptic meningitis. Thirty-five, 6 and 2 children developed meningitis, convulsive disorders and parotitis, respectively, within 2 months after MMR vaccination during the 8-month period extending from April to November, 1989. The time lag between MMR vaccination and meningitis ranged from 14 to 28 days in the 35 cases of meningitis. Mumps virus, isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid in 13 patients with aseptic meningitis, was characterized by determination of the nucleotide sequences of the P gene as mumps vaccine strain. The incidence of aseptic meningitis with positive mumps vaccine virus was estimated to be 0.11% (0.3% as a whole) during the 8 months from April to November and increased to 0.3% (0.7% as a whole) in September and October. We conclude that the incidence of aseptic meningitis after MMR vaccination seems to be higher than that reported previously.”

[Recurrent meningitis and inherited complement deficiency].
“The first patient had four attacks of meningococcal meningitis and an episode of pneumonia of unknown aetiology in childhood. The second had six attacks of meningitis. He also suffered from recurrent infections (otitis media, tonsillitis, chronic mucopurulent rhinitis and subsequent pansinusitis complicated by nasal polyposis) since childhood. No autoimmune disease was documented in either patient. They both received meningococcal and pneumococcal vaccines.”

Transmission of the L-Zagreb mumps vaccine virus, Croatia, 2005-2008.
“We report on three cases of symptomatic transmission of the L-Zagreb mumps vaccine virus from three vaccinated children to five adult contacts. The five contact cases were parents of the vaccinated children and presented with parotitis and in one case also with aseptic meningitis. The etiology of the contacts’ illness was determined by viral culture, genomic sequencing, serology and epidemiological linking. Two of the vaccinated children developed vaccine associated parotitis as an adverse event three weeks following immunization.”

Guillain-Barré syndrome among recipients of Menactra meningococcal conjugate vaccine-United States, June-July 2005.
“Case Reports
Case 1. A male aged 18 years was vaccinated with MCV4; 15 days later, he experienced tingling in his feet and hands. He had no history of major underlying illness; his mother had had GBS 5 years earlier. He reported no history of respiratory or gastrointestinal illnesses during the 6 weeks before onset of symptoms. Sixteen days after vaccination, he was hospitalized, and nerve conduction studies (NCS) of upper and lower extremities, 2 days after onset of symptoms, were consistent with GBS. He was observed for 3 days, discharged, and then readmitted 2 days later with bilateral facial weakness and increasing lower extremity weakness. Patellar, triceps, and biceps deep tendon reflexes (DTRs) were absent. NCS performed 4 days after the previous examination revealed worsening motor nerve conduction velocities consistent with GBS. Tests for mononucleosis and Lyme disease were negative. During hospitalization, he was treated with plasmapheresis. His facial palsy and gait improved, and his reflexes returned. He was discharged home.
Case 2. A male aged 17 years was vaccinated with MCV4; approximately 25 days later, he had difficulty walking, followed by difficulty moving from a standing to a seated position. Medical history included attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and Asperger syndrome; he had been taking multiple psychotropic medications. He did not report recent respiratory or gastrointestinal illness. Thirty-two days after vaccination, he was hospitalized with bilateral muscle weakness of upper and lower extremities with absent DTRs. NCS was consistent with GBS. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed 2 white blood cells (WBC)/mm3 with protein of 60 mg/dL; bacterial cultures were negative. DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for adenovirus, herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, varicella zoster virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and RNA PCR for West Nile virus, eastern equine encephalitis virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, enterovirus, and California group and Cache Valley viruses, were all negative. During hospitalization, he was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). On discharge, his motor strength and gait were improved.
Case 3. A female aged 17 years was vaccinated with MCV4. She had a previous history of GBS at ages 2 and 5 years, both beginning 14 days after vaccination with childhood vaccines. She had not been previously vaccinated with meningococcal vaccine. Both episodes of GBS were characterized by muscle weakness, decreased reflexes, and difficulty walking. During both episodes, she was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin and completely recovered. Fourteen days after vaccination with MCV4, she reported numbness of toes and tongue and had a lump in her throat. These symptoms were followed by numbness of thighs and fingertips, arm weakness, inability to run, difficulty walking, and falling. Sixteen days after vaccination, she was hospitalized, and neurologic examination revealed decreased tone and weakness of both arms and legs and reflexes reduced or absent in ankles, knees, and arms. CSF results revealed 0 WBC/mm3 and protein 26 mg/dL. She was treated with IVIG, recovered, and discharged home.
Case 4. A female aged 18 years was vaccinated with MCV4. Six days after vaccination, she had a sore throat that lasted for 6 days, and 29 days after vaccination she reported a severe headache and was evaluated in an emergency department (ED), where she had a normal computerized tomography (CT) scan, was treated with ketorolac, and discharged on oral ibuprofen. Thirty-one days after vaccination, the patient reported numbness of legs and had trouble standing on her toes. The next morning she could not stand. The patient was admitted to the hospital, and physical examination revealed decreased muscle strength in ankles and wrists bilaterally and reduced biceps, knee, and ankle DTRs. Previous medical history included mild ulcerative colitis that had been asymptomatic off medications; she did not report having diarrhea during the 6 weeks before onset of muscle weakness. Her only outpatient medications were oral contraceptives. CSF analysis revealed 1 WBC/mm3 and a protein concentration of 30 mg/dL. NCS was consistent with GBS. She was treated with IVIG. After a 7-day hospitalization, her motor strength had improved, and she was discharged home with outpatient physical therapy. Three weeks after discharge, her weakness and gait were improved.
Case 5. A female aged 18 years was vaccinated with MCV4; 14 days later, she experienced heaviness in her legs when walking upstairs. During the next 8 days, her difficulty walking continued, and she had bilateral leg pain. Subsequently, she reported headache, back and neck pain, vomiting, and tingling in both hands. She became unable to walk and was evaluated in an ED, where an initial diagnosis of viral meningitis was made. Two days later, she was hospitalized for progressive weakness and inability to walk. Neurologic examination revealed bilateral acute flaccid weakness with decreased DTRs.”

[Recurrent meningitis and inherited complement deficiency].
“The first patient had four attacks of meningococcal meningitis and an episode of pneumonia of unknown aetiology in childhood. The second had six attacks of meningitis. He also suffered from recurrent infections (otitis media, tonsillitis, chronic mucopurulent rhinitis and subsequent pansinusitis complicated by nasal polyposis) since childhood. No autoimmune disease was documented in either patient. They both received meningococcal and pneumococcal vaccines.”

    <h4>Are toxic biometals destroying your children's future?</h4>
    <p>"Cadmium, arsenic, lead, and mercury have been linked to autism, attention deficit disorder, mental retardation and death of children. Mercury in thimerosal found in many vaccines and flu shots contributes significantly to these problems. Decomposition of the thimerosal can produce more toxic compounds, either methylethylmercury or diethylmercury, in the body. These compounds have a toxicity level similar to dimethylmercury. Within the human body, a mitochondrial disorder may release the more toxic form of mercury internally. Young children and pregnant women must minimize internal exposure to the vaccines and flu shots containing mercury."</p>

    <h4>Neurodevelopmental disorders, maternal Rh-negativity, and Rho(D) immune globulins: a multi-center assessment.</h4>
    <p>"RESULTS: There were significant and comparable increases in maternal Rh-negativity among children with NDs (Clinic: A=24.2%), autism spectrum disorders (Clinic: A=28.3%, B=25.3%), and attention-deficit-disorder/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder (Clinic: A=26.3%) observed at both clinics in comparison to both control groups (Clinic: A=12.1%, B=13.9%) employed. Children with NDs born post-2001 had a maternal Rh-negativity frequency (13.6%) similar to controls. CONCLUSION: This study associates TCR exposure with some NDs in children."</p>

Doctor and MPs in Italy are assaulted after vaccination law is passed (2017) 
“A doctor and three MPs have been assaulted after protests in Italy against legislation requiring parents to vaccinate their children against 10 diseases by school age.
After the law passed through Italy’s lower house of parliament on Friday 28 July, anti-vaccine demonstrators assaulted three MPs outside the parliament building in Rome. The three parliamentarians—Elisa Mariano, Ludovico Vico, and Salvatore Capon of the ruling centre-left Democratic Party—were rescued by police officers from a mob shouting “killers.”
On 31 July it emerged that a man …”

Recent developments in understanding the role of the gut microbiota in brain health and disease. (2017)
“There is a growing appreciation of the role of the gut microbiota in all aspects of health and disease, including brain health. Indeed, roles for the bacterial commensals in various psychiatric and neurological conditions, such as depression, autism, stroke, Parkinson’s disease, and Alzheimer’s disease, are emerging. Microbiota dysregulation has been documented in all of these conditions or in animal models thereof. Moreover, depletion or modulation of the gut microbiota can affect the severity of the central pathology or behavioral deficits observed in a variety of brain disorders. However, the mechanisms underlying such effects are only slowly being unraveled. Additionally, recent preclinical and clinical evidence suggest that targeting the microbiota through prebiotic, probiotic, or dietary interventions may be an effective “psychobiotic” strategy for treating symptoms in mood, neurodevelopmental disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases.”

Vaccination Attitudes and Practices of Integrative Medicine Physicians.
“Integrative medicine physicians were less likely to administer vaccinations than physicians in traditional allopathic medicine. Among the 44% who provide vaccinations, 35% used alternative schedules regularly. Integrative medicine physicians showed a greater support of vaccination choice, were less concerned about maintaining herd immunity, and were less supportive of school, day care, and employment mandates. Toxic chemical and viral contaminants were of greater concern to a higher percentage of integrative medicine physicians. Integrative medicine physicians were also more likely to accept a connection between vaccinations and both autism and other chronic diseases. Overall, there was dissatisfaction with the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System as well as the vaccination recommendations of the CDC and their primary specialty. Conclusions • This survey documents significant variations in the vaccination attitudes and practices of integrative medicine physicians. This survey provides benchmark data for future surveys of this growing specialty and other practitioners. It is important for public health leaders and the vaccination industry to be aware that integrative medicine physicians have vaccination attitudes and practices that differ from the guidelines of the CDC and the Advisory Council on Immunization Practices.”

                                ð Are toxic biometals destroying your childrenâs future?
“Cadmium, arsenic, lead, and mercury have been linked to autism, attention deficit disorder, mental retardation and death of children. Mercury in thimerosal found in many vaccines and flu shots contributes significantly to these problems. Decomposition of the thimerosal can produce more toxic compounds, either methylethylmercury or diethylmercury, in the body. These compounds have a toxicity level similar to dimethylmercury. Within the human body, a mitochondrial disorder may release the more toxic form of mercury internally. Young children and pregnant women must minimize internal exposure to the vaccines and flu shots containing mercury.”

Thimerosal induces neuronal cell apoptosis by causing cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor release from mitochondria.
“There is a worldwide increasing concern over the neurological risks of thimerosal (ethylmercury thiosalicylate) which is an organic mercury compound that is commonly used as an antimicrobial preservative. In this study, we show that thimerosal, at nanomolar concentrations, induces neuronal cell death through the mitochondrial pathway. Thimerosal, in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, decreased cell viability as assessed by calcein-ethidium staining and caused apoptosis detected by Hoechst 33258 dye. Thimerosal-induced apoptosis was associated with depolarization of mitochondrial membrane, generation of reactive oxygen species, and release of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from mitochondria to cytosol. Although thimerosal did not affect cellular expression of Bax at the protein level, we observed translocation of Bax from cytosol to mitochondria. Finally, caspase-9 and caspase-3 were activated in the absence of caspase-8 activation. Our data suggest that thimerosal causes apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells by changing the mitochondrial microenvironment.”

Acetaminophen (paracetamol) use, measles-mumps-rubella vaccination, and autistic disorder: the results of a parent survey.
“The present study was performed to determine whether acetaminophen (paracetamol) use after the measles-mumps-rubella vaccination could be associated with autistic disorder. This case-control study used the results of an online parental survey conducted from 16 July 2021 to 30 January 2006, consisting of 83 children with autistic disorder and 80 control children. Acetaminophen use after measles-mumps-rubella vaccination was significantly associated with autistic disorder when considering children 5 years of age or less (OR 6.11, 95% CI 1.42-26.3), after limiting cases to children with regression in development (OR 3.97, 95% CI 1.11-14.3), and when considering only children who had post-vaccination sequelae (OR 8.23, 95% CI 1.56-43.3), adjusting for age, gender, mother’s ethnicity, and the presence of illness concurrent with measles-mumps-rubella vaccination. Ibuprofen use after measles-mumps-rubella vaccination was not associated with autistic disorder. This preliminary study found that acetaminophen use after measles-mumps-rubella vaccination was associated with autistic disorder.”

🛑 Adverse events associated with childhood vaccines other than pertussis and rubella. Summary of a report from the Institute of Medicine. 
The committee found that the evidence favored acceptance of a causal relation between diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and Guillain-Barré syndrome and brachial neuritis, between measles vaccine and anaphylaxis, between oral polio vaccine and Guillain-Barré syndrome, and between unconjugated Hib vaccine and susceptibility to Hib disease. The committee found that the evidence established causality between diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and anaphylaxis, between measles vaccine and death from measles vaccine-strain viral infection, between measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and thrombocytopenia and anaphylaxis, between oral polio vaccine and poliomyelitis and death from polio vaccine-strain viral infection, and between hepatitis B vaccine and anaphylaxis.

Anaphylactic reactions to measles-mumps-rubella vaccine in three children with allergies to hen’s egg and cow’s milk.
“AIM: Allergies to hen’s egg and cow’s milk are the most frequent food allergies in infancy and childhood. Current guidelines recommend safe administration of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine in egg allergic patients.
METHODS: We present three cases of anaphylaxis that we encountered after MMR vaccination in children sensitized to hen’s egg and cow’s milk.
RESULTS: Even though MMR vaccine is generally known to be safe in children with egg allergy, there may still be isolated cases of anaphylaxis.
CONCLUSION: Therefore, we recommend that all children not only those who were sensitized to foods should receive the MMR vaccination in a setting that is equipped to deal with anaphylactic reactions. As stated by WHO in immunization safety surveillance, ‘Each vaccinator must have an emergency kit with adrenaline, and be familiar with its dosage and administration’.

Epidemiological characteristics of childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia. Analysis by immunophenotype. The Childrens Cancer Group.
“Factors with elevated and/or significant ORs included: (i) for common ALL (n = 286): Down syndrome; family history (FH) of bone/joint diseases; postnatal jaundice; birthweight; MMR vaccination;…” 
“While a number of epidemiological studies of childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) have been conducted, separate analysis of risk factors for ALL subtypes has generally not been possible. We report the results of an analysis of data obtained from parents of children with ALL (and a control group of children without cancer), linked to a clinical database. Cases were classified into four ALL subtypes, and odds ratios (OR) were determined for each subtype for a broad range of factors. Numerous significant associations were found, some across all subtypes and others that were subtype-specific. Factors with elevated and/or significant ORs included: (i) for common ALL (n = 286): Down syndrome; family history (FH) of bone/joint diseases; postnatal jaundice; birthweight; MMR vaccination; exposure to gases and insecticides; and parental occupational exposure to insecticides. (ii) for pre-B ALL (n = 38): FH of gastrointestinal, hematological or bone/joint diseases, or allergy; cat ownership; exposure to solvents, fumes, petroleum products, cleaning agents and farm animals; and parental exposure to farm animals, fumes and solvents; (iii) for T-cell ALL (n = 158): FH of gastrointestinal disorders, maternal age, male gender, and parental occupational exposure to metals; (iv) for null-cell ALL (n = 65): FH of congenital heart disorders; measles; and parental occupational exposure to fumes, metals or solvents. This analysis should be considered as a hypothesis-generating process for future case-control interview studies.”

Fatal adult respiratory distress syndrome in a scalded child after immunization with attenuated virus (measles, mumps and rubella).
“A fatal adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurred in a 15-month-old child who had suffered minor scalding during the febrile response to combined attenuated virus immunization (measles, mumps and rubella [MMR]). Despite vigorous efforts the child died 26 days after the accident. It is suggested that the scalding suppressed the normal immune response to the viremia and that the latter (i.e. most likely the measles viremia) caused the lung damage which, in turn, led to the ARDS.”

“These scientific and medical advances are dependent on the use of fetal tissue from aborted fetuses. While the practice of induced abortion despite societal benefit may be theologically objectionable to some, these practices are professionally responsible. Federal regulations exist to discourage patients from being influenced by the societal benefit of fetal research in arriving at the decision to terminate as well as to prevent researchers from influencing a patient’s decision.”

Horizontal transmission of the Leningrad-Zagreb mumps vaccine strain: a report of six symptomatic cases of parotitis and one case of meningitis.
“Here we report horizontal symptomatic transmission of the Leningrad-Zagreb (L-Zagreb) mumps vaccine virus. Children who were the source of transmission had been vaccinated with the MMR vaccine (Serum Institute of India) contained L-Zagreb mumps virus. This is the first report of horizontal symptomatic transmission of this vaccine. The etiology of all seven contact cases was confirmed by epidemiological linking, serology and by F, SH, NP and HN mumps virus genes sequencing.”

Local public health response to vaccine-associated measles: case report.
“A five-year-old Canadian-born boy with a history of a hematopoetic stem cell transplant three years previously received live attenuated measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Over the subsequent 7 to 14 days, he developed an illness clinically consistent with measles. There was no travel history or other measles exposure. Serology and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing confirmed acute measles infection.”

Mumps vaccine associated orchitis: Evidence supporting a potential immune-mediated mechanism. 
“We report 3 cases of orchitis following vaccination with mumps-measles-rubella (MMR) vaccine, two with an onset within 3 days following vaccination. Orchitis is a common complication of mumps infection, particularly in post-pubertal males, and is also recognized as a very rare complication of mumps vaccination. These cases, discussed together with a comprehensive review of the existing literature regarding post-vaccine orchitis, highlight uncertainty regarding the pathogenesis of post-vaccine orchitis.”

Neuropathology of vaccination in infants and children.
“AIMS: Documentation of clinical-pathological features of 37 infants/children whose parents alleged a relationship between vaccination and death or permanent central nervous system (CNS) damage, and sought compensation through the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.
SCOPE: Of the 5545 claims filed during the 10-year period (1990-1999), CNS tissue was available for evaluation by a pediatric neuropathologist in 37; 33 died and 4 had a biopsy or lobectomy. Most commonly implicated vaccines were DTP/DTaP, followed by MMR and IPV/OPV, but almost all of the vaccines currently given to infants/children were alleged to be responsible for the illness/death. No lesions were found in 5 of 37 (13.5%). The most frequent abnormality consisted of acute anoxic encephalopathy (14 of 37 - 37.8%), consequent to several different causes, such as positional asphyxia, cardio-respiratory arrest during status epilepticus, etc. The remaining children manifested other lesions, including inflammation (5 of 37 - 13.5%), vascular and developmental anomalies (4 each of 37 or 10.6%), cerebral edema and system degeneration (2 each of 37 or 5.4%), and one case of heavy metal exposure in a child living near an abandoned mine (2.2%).”

Postpartum live virus vaccination: lessons from veterinary medicine.
“Pregnant rubella-susceptible women are often revaccinated during the postpartum period with the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella vaccine (MMR). It is known that the rubella virus from vaccine is secreted in breast milk and persists in the nose and throat for up to 28 days but it is not known whether the measles and mumps viruses are similarly secreted. It is probable the measles virus from vaccine is.”

A prefecture-wide survey of mumps meningitis associated with measles, mumps and rubella vaccine.
“A survey of untoward reactions, especially central nervous system reactions, after the administration of a newly introduced measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine in Gunma Prefecture, Japan, was initiated soon after 4 patients were hospitalized for aseptic meningitis. Thirty-five, 6 and 2 children developed meningitis, convulsive disorders and parotitis, respectively, within 2 months after MMR vaccination during the 8-month period extending from April to November, 1989. The time lag between MMR vaccination and meningitis ranged from 14 to 28 days in the 35 cases of meningitis. Mumps virus, isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid in 13 patients with aseptic meningitis, was characterized by determination of the nucleotide sequences of the P gene as mumps vaccine strain. The incidence of aseptic meningitis with positive mumps vaccine virus was estimated to be 0.11% (0.3% as a whole) during the 8 months from April to November and increased to 0.3% (0.7% as a whole) in September and October. We conclude that the incidence of aseptic meningitis after MMR vaccination seems to be higher than that reported previously.”

Reports of sensorineural deafness after measles, mumps, and rubella immunisation.
“There have been nine reports of sensorineural hearing loss after measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) immunisation. In three cases the deafness was unrelated to MMR immunisation. In six cases the cause was unknown and MMR remained a possible aetiology. Any risk associated with attenuated viruses must be weighed against the risks of the natural diseases.”

Rubella and congenital rubella (German measles).
“Issues of risk, choice, and chance are central to the controversy over the MMR vaccine that erupted in the UK in 1998, and has continued into the new millennium. An important contribution to the MMR controversy has come from the parents of autistic children, some of whom reject the notion that this disorder is a random genetic misfortune and insist that it is, at least in part, the result of some environmental insult, such as MMR vaccinations.”

Transmission of the L-Zagreb mumps vaccine virus, Croatia, 2005-2008.
“We report on three cases of symptomatic transmission of the L-Zagreb mumps vaccine virus from three vaccinated children to five adult contacts. The five contact cases were parents of the vaccinated children and presented with parotitis and in one case also with aseptic meningitis. The etiology of the contacts’ illness was determined by viral culture, genomic sequencing, serology and epidemiological linking. Two of the vaccinated children developed vaccine associated parotitis as an adverse event three weeks following immunization.”

Use of the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register for vaccine safety data
“An increase in febrile convulsions 6-11 days post-MMR vaccination was demonstrated which equates to a vaccine-attributable risk of 1 convulsion per 6753 vaccines. This study confirms the known association between MMR vaccination and febrile convulsions and in doing so demonstrates the feasibility of using the ACIR for data linkage and vaccine safety surveillance.”

🛑 [Vaccines, biotechnology and their connection with induced abortion].
“Diploid cells (WI-38, MRC-5) vaccines have their origin in induced abortions. Among these vaccines we fi nd the following: rubella, measles, mumps, rabies, polio, smallpox, hepatitis A, chickenpox, and herpes zoster. Nowadays, other abortion tainted vaccines cultivated on transformed cells (293, PER.C6) are in the pipeline: flu, Respiratory Syncytial and parainfluenza viruses, HIV, West Nile virus, Ebola, Marburg and Lassa, hepatitis B and C, foot and mouth disease, Japanese encephalitis, dengue, tuberculosis, anthrax, plague, tetanus and malaria. The same method is used for the production of monoclonal antibodies and other proteins, gene therapy and genomics. Technology enables us to develop the aforementioned products without resorting to induced abortion. Full disclosure of the cell origin in the labelling of vaccines and other products must be supported. There are vaccines from non-objectionable sources which should be made available to the public. When no alternative vaccines exist, ethical research must be promoted. Non-objectionable sources in the production of monoclonal antibodies, gene therapy and genomics must be encouraged. It is not be consistent to abstain from products originated in embryonic stem cells and at the same time approve of products obtained from induced abortions. It is of paramount importance to avoid that induced abortion technology seeps into every field of Medicine.”

What is the cause of a rash after measles-mumps-rubella vaccination?
“We describe a 17-month-old child with fever and rash after measles-mumps-rubella vaccination. Detection of vaccine-strain
measles virus in his urine by poly
merase chain reaction confirmed the diagnosis of a vaccine reaction rather than wild-type measles. We propose that measles virus should be sought and identified as vaccine or wild-type virus when the relationship between vaccination and measles-like illness is uncertain.”

ð Adverse effect versus quality control of the Fuenzalida-Palacios antirabies vaccine.
“We evaluated the components of the Fuenzalida-Palacios antirabies vaccine, which is till used in most developing countries in human immunization for treatment and prophylaxis. This vaccine is prepared from newborn mouse brains at 1% concentration. Even though the vaccine is considered to have a low myelin content, it is not fully free of myelin or of other undesirable components that might trigger adverse effects after vaccination. The most severe effect is a post-vaccination neuroparalytic accident associated with Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome. In the present study we demonstrate how the vaccines produced and distributed by different laboratories show different component patterns with different degrees of impurity and with varying protein concentrations, indicating that production processes can vary from one laboratory to another. These differences, which could be resolved using a better quality control process, may affect and impair immunization, with consequent risks and adverse effects after vaccination. We used crossed immunoelectrophoresis to evaluate and demonstrate the possibility of quality control in vaccine production, reducing the risk factors possibly involved in these immunizing products.”

Multiple sclerosis and hepatitis B vaccination: could minute contamination of the vaccine by partial hepatitis B virus polymerase play a role through molecular mimicry?
“Reports of multiple sclerosis developing after hepatitis B vaccination have led to the concern that this vaccine might be a cause of multiple sclerosis in previously healthy subjects. Some articles evidenced that minor Hepatitis B virus (HBV) polymerase proteins could be produced by alternative transcriptional or translational strategies. Their detection is very difficult because they are in minute concentration and probably enzymatically inactive, however, it was shown that they could be exposed on the outside of the virus particles and also be immunogenic. In addition, HBV polymerase shares significant amino acid similarities with the human myelin basic protein. We hypothesise that some of the apparent adverse reactions to the vaccine could be due to a process called of molecular mimicry, the HBV polymerase, which could be a contaminant in the recombinant or plasma-derived vaccines, could act as autoantigens and induce autoimmune demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis.”

CNS demyelination and quadrivalent HPV vaccination.
“Vaccination is generally considered safe in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). We report five patients who presented with multifocal or atypical demyelinating syndromes within 21 days of immunization with the quadrivalent human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine, Gardasil. Although the target population for vaccination, young females, has an inherently high risk for MS, the temporal association with demyelinating events in these cases may be explained by the potent immuno-stimulatory properties of HPV virus-like particles which comprise the vaccine. A prospective case-control study of patients with MS or clinically isolated demyelinating syndromes receiving the Gardasil vaccine may provide relevant safety data in this population.”

🛑 Demyelinating disease and polyvalent human papilloma virus vaccination
“Since its inception, the polyvalent vaccine against the human papilloma virus (HPV), Gardasil, has generated some controversies as a temporal relationship between the administrations of the vaccine and the development of a few autoimmune diseases, such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), multiple sclerosis (MS) and Guillain–Barre syndrome have been reported.1–3 We encountered two cases whose initial presentation of CNS demyelination followed in close time relationship the administration of Gardasil vaccine and we discuss their possible association.
Case No 1
A 19-year-old woman received two doses of Gardasil, 3 months apart, and approximately 1 month after the second dose, she developed numbness to the right foot that within 1 day extended to the contralateral foot and was associated with mid-thoracic back pain. Her neurological examination was only significant for the altered perception to touch to the feet. Deep tendon reflexes were normal and plantar reflexes in flexion. MRI of cervical and thoracic spine revealed a total of three lesions with characteristic demyelinating appearance, one of those in the thoracic spine was contrast-enhancing (figure 1A–C). MRI brain demonstrated one additional white matter lesion also consistent with a demyelinating process.”

Deep sequencing reveals persistence of cell-associated mumps vaccine virus in chronic encephalitis.
“Notwithstanding this, we describe here devastating neurological complications associated with the detection of live-attenuated mumps virus Jeryl Lynn (MuV(JL5)) in the brain of a child who had undergone successful allogeneic transplantation for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). This is the first confirmed report of MuV(JL5) associated with chronic encephalitis and highlights the need to exclude immunodeficient individuals from immunisation with live-attenuated vaccines.”

Molecular Analysis of Early Postvaccine Mumps-like Disease in Italian Military Recruits
“To the Editor: Italian military recruits have received mandatory mumps vaccination by Urabe Am9 strain since 1998. A previous study1 found that, in 1999, 37 episodes of mumps-like disease were found in recipients of the vaccine, and that 35 of these occurred within 1 month of immunization. To assess whether these cases were due to some expected residual virulence of the live attenuated Urabe Am9 mumps strain, we analyzed saliva samples from recruits who developed mumps-like disease within 1 month of vaccination.”

Mumps vaccine associated orchitis: Evidence supporting a potential immune-mediated mechanism. 
“We report 3 cases of orchitis following vaccination with mumps-measles-rubella (MMR) vaccine, two with an onset within 3 days following vaccination. Orchitis is a common complication of mumps infection, particularly in post-pubertal males, and is also recognized as a very rare complication of mumps vaccination. These cases, discussed together with a comprehensive review of the existing literature regarding post-vaccine orchitis, highlight uncertainty regarding the pathogenesis of post-vaccine orchitis.”

ð [Mumps vaccine virus transmission].
“In this work we report the mumps vaccine virus shedding based on the laboratory confirmed cases of the mumps virus (MuV) infection. The likely epidemiological sources of the transmitted mumps virus were children who were recently vaccinated with the mumps vaccine containing Leningrad-Zagreb or Leningrad-3 MuV. The etiology of the described cases of the horizontal transmission of both mumps vaccine viruses was confirmed by PCR with the sequential restriction analysis.”

A prefecture-wide survey of mumps meningitis associated with measles, mumps and rubella vaccine.
“A survey of untoward reactions, especially central nervous system reactions, after the administration of a newly introduced measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine in Gunma Prefecture, Japan, was initiated soon after 4 patients were hospitalized for aseptic meningitis. Thirty-five, 6 and 2 children developed meningitis, convulsive disorders and parotitis, respectively, within 2 months after MMR vaccination during the 8-month period extending from April to November, 1989. The time lag between MMR vaccination and meningitis ranged from 14 to 28 days in the 35 cases of meningitis. Mumps virus, isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid in 13 patients with aseptic meningitis, was characterized by determination of the nucleotide sequences of the P gene as mumps vaccine strain. The incidence of aseptic meningitis with positive mumps vaccine virus was estimated to be 0.11% (0.3% as a whole) during the 8 months from April to November and increased to 0.3% (0.7% as a whole) in September and October. We conclude that the incidence of aseptic meningitis after MMR vaccination seems to be higher than that reported previously.”

ð Transmission of mumps virus from mumps-vaccinated individuals to close contacts.
“During a recent mumps epidemic in the Netherlands caused by a genotype D mumps virus strain, we investigated the potential of vaccinated people to spread mumps disease to close contacts. We compared mumps viral titers of oral fluid specimens obtained by quantitative PCR from vaccinated (n=60) and unvaccinated (n=111) mumps patients. We also investigated the occurrence of mumps infection among the household contacts of vaccinated mumps patients. We found that viral titers are higher for unvaccinated patients than for vaccinated patients during the 1st 3 days after onset of disease. While no symptomatic cases were reported among the household contacts (n=164) of vaccinated mumps patients (n=36), there were cases with serological evidence of asymptomatic infection among vaccinated household contacts (9 of 66 vaccinated siblings). For two of these siblings, the vaccinated index patient was the most probable source of infection. We conclude that, in this particular outbreak, the risk of a close contact becoming infected by vaccinated patients was small, but present.

Transmission of the L-Zagreb mumps vaccine virus, Croatia, 2005-2008.
“We report on three cases of symptomatic transmission of the L-Zagreb mumps vaccine virus from three vaccinated children to five adult contacts. The five contact cases were parents of the vaccinated children and presented with parotitis and in one case also with aseptic meningitis. The etiology of the contactsâ illness was determined by viral culture, genomic sequencing, serology and epidemiological linking. Two of the vaccinated children developed vaccine associated parotitis as an adverse event three weeks following immunization.”

ð [Vaccines, biotechnology and their connection with induced abortion].
“Diploid cells (WI-38, MRC-5) vaccines have their origin in induced abortions. Among these vaccines we fi nd the following: rubella, measles, mumps, rabies, polio, smallpox, hepatitis A, chickenpox, and herpes zoster. Nowadays, other abortion tainted vaccines cultivated on transformed cells (293, PER.C6) are in the pipeline: flu, Respiratory Syncytial and parainfluenza viruses, HIV, West Nile virus, Ebola, Marburg and Lassa, hepatitis B and C, foot and mouth disease, Japanese encephalitis, dengue, tuberculosis, anthrax, plague, tetanus and malaria. The same method is used for the production of monoclonal antibodies and other proteins, gene therapy and genomics. Technology enables us to develop the aforementioned products without resorting to induced abortion. Full disclosure of the cell origin in the labelling of vaccines and other products must be supported. There are vaccines from non-objectionable sources which should be made available to the public. When no alternative vaccines exist, ethical research must be promoted. Non-objectionable sources in the production of monoclonal antibodies, gene therapy and genomics must be encouraged. It is not be consistent to abstain from products originated in embryonic stem cells and at the same time approve of products obtained from induced abortions. It is of paramount importance to avoid that induced abortion technology seeps into every field of Medicine.”

                                Adjuvants- and vaccines-induced autoimmunity: animal models.
“In some cases, adjuvants may trigger generalized autoimmune response, resulting in multiple auto-antibodies, but sometimes they can reproduce human autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren syndrome, autoimmune thyroiditis and antiphospholipid syndrome and may provide insights about the potential adverse effects of adjuvants.”

A case of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) following Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination.
“A 15-year-old young woman received the Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines. Following the second HPV vaccination, intermittent fever, myalgia, arthritis and malar rash developed, and she was admitted to our hospital. Laboratory studies showed positive results for antinuclear antibody, anti-dsDNA antibody and anti-Sm antibody. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was diagnosed according to the Systemic Lupus International Collaborative Clinics 2012. Magnetic resonance imaging showed abnormal hyperintense areas in the fascia, and en bloc biopsy showed fasciitis. Treatment with prednisolone resulted in an amelioration of the symptoms. Reportedly, SLE developed after HPV vaccinations in some patients. Most such patients have a past or family history of autoimmune disease and presented SLE symptoms after the second vaccination. We describe herein a patient in whom SLE developed in association with HPV vaccination.”

Severe polymyositis was observed in one case. Five infants died 12 h to 4 days after vaccination: two after acute encephalopathy and three in the form of a sudden unexpected death (SID). In two fatal cases the morphological changes in the brain corresponded to those of pertussis encephalopathy: neuronal degeneration in various parts of the cortex, especially in the region of the ammons horn, and in the cerebellum. There were no signs of inflammation. Three cases underwent forensic autopsy and death was attributed to bronchopulmonary infection. Complete neuropathological work-up was only done in one case, in which the brain was normal. The critique of episodical reports and the demand for prospective studies is appreciated. Knowledge of all possible forms of complications, however, is indispensable for future investigations. Polymyositis and SID have so far not been listed as abnormal reactions to immunization. The majority of our cases became known accidentally from hospital sheets or from discussions with collegues. For a detection of all possible cases a greater awareness of doctors for the problem of pertussis immunization appears necessary. Only another 23 cases have been reported to the health authorities of the state of Lower Saxony during the last 6 to 7 years. Of those, nine were either harmless reactions or diseases probably unrelated to vaccination. Two were cases of SID, 12 and 72 h after vaccination. It is concluded that only a minor proportion of possible complications is presently reported to the health authorities.”

Macrophagic myofasciitis associated with vaccine-derived aluminium.
“Macrophagic myofasciitis is characterised by sheets of macrophages in striated muscle, a few lymphocytes and inconspicuous muscle fibre damage. It is due to aluminium contained in vaccines, and is localised to the inoculation site. We report the first Australian case, detected incidentally when investigating a raised serum creatine kinase level.”

“RESULTS: There were significant and comparable increases in maternal Rh-negativity among children with NDs (Clinic: A=24.2%), autism spectrum disorders (Clinic: A=28.3%, B=25.3%), and attention-deficit-disorder/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder (Clinic: A=26.3%) observed at both clinics in comparison to both control groups (Clinic: A=12.1%, B=13.9%) employed. Children with NDs born post-2001 had a maternal Rh-negativity frequency (13.6%) similar to controls.
CONCLUSION: This study associates TCR exposure with some NDs in children.”

“Recently emerging evidence suggests that mercury, especially from childhood vaccines, appears to be a factor in the development of the autistic disorders, and that autistic children have higher than normal body-burdens of mercury. In considering mercury toxicity, it has previously been shown that testosterone significantly potentates mercury toxicity, whereas estrogen is protective.”

                                Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis After Influenza Vaccination: A Case Report
“Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis developed in a 42-year-old woman within 3 weeks of receiving the seasonal influenza vaccine. She had 80% recovery after 3 months of treatment with methylprednisolone. Although cases of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis after vaccination for influenza are rare, enough of them have occurred that critical care nurses should be aware of the possibility. Early treatment can prevent serious residual signs and symptoms; therefore, correct and quick diagnosis is important. Medical history obtained from patients with central nervous system problems should include history of recent vaccinations.”

ð [Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis after tetanus vaccination of a pregnant woman in Senegal].
Although neurological complications have been described after tetanus vaccinations, they are rare. The authors report a case of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) in a 28-year-old pregnant woman at a gestational age of 10 weeks, admitted 15 days after a tetanus vaccination, with spastic tetraplegia and sphincter disturbances. Corticosteroid treatment led to partial recovery of the neurological deficit. Differential diagnosis of infectious and demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system is difficult in view of clinical and laboratory aspects of post-vaccination ADEM. Without any specific diagnostic markers, the clinical examination, magnetic resonance imaging and negative etiological findings were key to this diagnosis. Medical staff must bear in mind the possible complications of this vaccine.

Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis associated with oral polio vaccine.
“A 27-year-old woman presented with acute paresis after taking an oral polio vaccine (OPV). Deep tendon reflexes were preserved, needle electromyography showed no neurogenic changes, and there were no lesions on spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), suggesting that motor neurons of the spinal cord were not affected. Brain MRI showed abnormal lesions in the tegmentum of the upper pons, left cerebral peduncles, truncus of the corpus callosum, and right parietal lobe. Cerebrospinal fluid revealed mild pleocytosis. The most probable diagnosis was acute disseminated encephalomyelitis associated with OPV.”

Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis following inactivated influenza vaccination in the Brazilian Amazon: a case report
“Here, we describe a case of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) that occurred during a plausible risk interval following inactivated influenza vaccination in a previously healthy 27-year-old man from Manaus, Brazil. He was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone and immunoglobulin. One-month follow-up revealed resolution of the brain lesions, but not of the spinal cord lesions. No recurrence or progression of the main neurological symptoms was observed. After two years of monitoring, the patient continues to experience weak lower limbs and urinary retention. Thus, we recommend that ADEM should be considered in a patient presenting with neurological symptoms after influenza vaccination.”

Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis following Vaccination against Hepatitis B in a Child: A Case Report and Literature Review
“Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, which has been associated with several vaccines such as rabies, diphtheria-tetanus-polio, smallpox, measles, mumps, rubella, Japanese B encephalitis, pertussis, influenza, and the Hog vaccine. Here, we presented a case of 12-year-old child who suffered from ADEM three weeks after hepatitis B vaccination. He was admitted to our hospital with symptoms of weakness of limbs, high fever, and alteration of consciousness. Some abnormalities were also found in CSF. Treatment with high-dose corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin had significant effect, with marked improvement of the clinical symptoms and the results of CSF. The findings of MRI also detected some abnormal lesions located in both brain and spinal cord. The clinical features, the findings of CSF and MRI, and therapeutic effect may contribute to such diagnosis of ADEM.”

ð Adverse effect versus quality control of the Fuenzalida-Palacios antirabies vaccine.Â 
“We evaluated the components of the Fuenzalida-Palacios antirabies vaccine, which is till used in most developing countries in human immunization for treatment and prophylaxis. This vaccine is prepared from newborn mouse brains at 1% concentration. Even though the vaccine is considered to have a low myelin content, it is not fully free of myelin or of other undesirable components that might trigger adverse effects after vaccination. The most severe effect is a post-vaccination neuroparalytic accident associated with Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome. In the present study we demonstrate howÂ the vaccinesproduced and distributed by different laboratories show different component patterns with different degrees of impurity and with varying protein concentrations, indicating that production processes can vary from one laboratory to another. These differences, which could be resolved using a better quality control process, may affect and impair immunization, with consequent risks and adverse effects after vaccination. We used crossed immunoelectrophoresis to evaluate and demonstrate the possibility of quality control in vaccine production, reducing the risk factors possibly involved in these immunizing products.”

Attempts in recent years either to remove the paralytic factor from brain-tissue vaccines or to use as the virus source infected tissue other than nervous tissue (e.g., chick embryos) have usually resulted in a substantial reduction of the specific antirabies potency.”

Association of acute cerebellar ataxia and human papilloma virus vaccination: a case report.
“INTRODUCTION: We report the case of a patient who developed symptoms of acute cerebellar ataxia (ACA) after administration of the human papilloma virus (HPV)-16/18 vaccine.
PATIENT AND METHOD: This patient developed symptoms of ACA, including nausea, vertigo, severe limb and truncal ataxia, and bilateral spontaneous continuous horizontal nystagmus with irregular rhythm, 12 days after administration of the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted cervical cancer vaccine. After this, the patient received methylprednisolone pulse and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapies as well as immunoadsorption plasmapheresis.
RESULTS: Severe ACA symptoms did not improve after methylprednisolone pulse and IVIG therapies, but the patient recovered completely after immunoadsorption plasmapheresis.
CONCLUSION: This temporal association strongly suggests that ACA was induced by the vaccination.”

CNS demyelination and quadrivalent HPV vaccination.
“Vaccination is generally considered safe in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). We report five patients who presented with multifocal or atypical demyelinating syndromes within 21 days of immunization with the quadrivalent human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine, Gardasil. Although the target population for vaccination, young females, has an inherently high risk for MS, the temporal association with demyelinating events in these cases may be explained by the potent immuno-stimulatory properties of HPV virus-like particles which comprise the vaccine. A prospective case-control study of patients with MS or clinically isolated demyelinating syndromes receiving the Gardasil vaccine may provide relevant safety data in this population.”

ð [Complications of pertussis immunization (author transl)].
“16 cases of neurological disease and/or death shortly after pertussis immunization are reported. Eight patients had convulsions, six with ensuing permanent defects. Severe polymyositis was observed in one case. Five infants died 12 h to 4 days after vaccination: two after acute encephalopathy and three in the form of a sudden unexpected death (SID). In two fatal cases the morphological changes in the brain corresponded to those of pertussis encephalopathy: neuronal degeneration in various parts of the cortex, especially in the region of the ammons horn, and in the cerebellum. There were no signs of inflammation. Three cases underwent forensic autopsy and death was attributed to bronchopulmonary infection. Complete neuropathological work-up was only done in one case, in which the brain was normal. The critique of episodical reports and the demand for prospective studies is appreciated. Knowledge of all possible forms of complications, however, is indispensable for future investigations. Polymyositis and SID have so far not been listed as abnormal reactions to immunization. The majority of our cases became known accidentally from hospital sheets or from discussions with collegues. For a detection of all possible cases a greater awareness of doctors for the problem of pertussis immunization appears necessary. Only another 23 cases have been reported to the health authorities of the state of Lower Saxony during the last 6 to 7 years. Of those, nine were either harmless reactions or diseases probably unrelated to vaccination. Two were cases of SID, 12 and 72 h after vaccination. It is concluded that only a minor proportion of possible complications is presently reported to the health authorities.”

ð Demyelinating disease and polyvalent human papilloma virus vaccination
“Since its inception, the polyvalent vaccine against the human papilloma virus (HPV), Gardasil, has generated some controversies as a temporal relationship between the administrations of the vaccine and the development of a few autoimmune diseases, such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), multiple sclerosis (MS) and GuillainâBarre syndrome have been reported.1â3 We encountered two cases whose initial presentation of CNS demyelination followed in close time relationship the administration of Gardasil vaccine and we discuss their possible association.
Case No 1
A 19-year-old woman received two doses of Gardasil, 3 months apart, and approximately 1 month after the second dose, she developed numbness to the right foot that within 1 day extended to the contralateral foot and was associated with mid-thoracic back pain. Her neurological examination was only significant for the altered perception to touch to the feet. Deep tendon reflexes were normal and plantar reflexes in flexion. MRI of cervical and thoracic spine revealed a total of three lesions with characteristic demyelinating appearance, one of those in the thoracic spine was contrast-enhancing (figure 1AâC). MRI brain demonstrated one additional white matter lesion also consistent with a demyelinating process.”

[Demyelinating disease and vaccination of the human papillomavirus].
“CASE REPORTS: We describe the cases of four young women that developed demyelinating disease after the vaccination of the HPV, with a rank of time between the administration of the dose and the development of the clinical of seven days to a month, with similar symptoms with the successive doses. We have described six episodes coinciding after the vaccination.
CONCLUSIONS: Have been described seizures, autoimmune disorders such as Guillain-Barre syndrome, transverse myelitis, or motor neuron disease, probably adverse effects following immunization by HPV vaccine. So we suggest that vaccine may trigger an immunological mechanism leading to demyelinating events, perhaps in predisposed young.”

Encephalitis related to a H1N1 vaccination: case report and review of the literature.
“RESULTS: We report a case of a 26-year-old female who developed symptoms of acute encephalitis 5 days after vaccination against the pandemic 2009 A/H1N1 influenza. MRI of the brain showed confluent T2-hyperintense signal intensity changes in the deep white matter which further confirmed the diagnosis of encephalitis/acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Despite therapy with immunoglobulins and corticosteroids, her persistent vegetative state continued. In light of the dramatic cause of this case, we reviewed all 21 other previously reported cases of central nervous system demyelination related to H1N1 vaccination and/or infection.
CONCLUSIONS: The available data suggest that even severe central nervous system demyelination i.e. acute encephalitis/disseminated encephalomyelitis and transverse myelitis may very rarely be associated with vaccination against novel influenza A/H1N1 or with A/H1N1 infection itself.”

“Although only 114 virologically-confirmed paralytic cases were identified in the eight cVDPV outbreaks, it is likely that a minimum of hundreds of thousands, and more likely several million individuals were infected during these events, and that many thousands more have been infected by VDPV lineages within outbreaks which have escaped detection.”

Fetal damage after accidental polio vaccination of an immune mother.
“Irreparable damage to the anterior horn cells of the cervical and thoracic cord was found in a 20-week-old fetus whose mother was immune to poliomyelitis before conceiving but who was inadvertently given oral polio vaccine at 18 weeks gestation. Polio neutralizing antibody titres in sera, taken before and after pregnancy, were identical and were at levels normally regarded as providing protection. Unsuccessful attempts were made to isolate poliovirus from extracts of fetal brain, lung, liver and placenta. Fluorescent antibody tests were performed on various levels of the central nervous system and on the left and right extensor forearm muscles. Specific positive fluorescence to poliovirus 2 and 3 antigens was detected at dorsal spinal cord level only. One positive result was seen with Coxsackie A9 antiserum and fresh guinea-pig complement in the inflammatory cells in the right extensor forearm muscles.This experience, as yet unexplained, underlines the importance of ensuring that women are not pregnant prior to oral polio vaccination.”

Guillain-Barre syndrome after influenza vaccine administration: two adult cases.
“We describe two adult cases of neurologic complications occurring after the administration of the influenza vaccine. The first case described is a 68 year-old man who experienced paresthesias of the upper and lower extremities two weeks after vaccination, and the second case was a 64 year-old female who exhibited paraplegia eighteen days after vaccination. Diagnosis of acute idiopathic demyelinating polyradiculopathy (Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome) was made for both patients, and intravenous gammaglobulin therapy was given with marked improvement of the first case, but poor response on the second case. Although the efficacy of influenza vaccination has been widely accepted, such neurologic complications might occur in the elderly and adult population. Even if Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome was a true side effect of vaccination, the risk is substantially lower than is the risk for complications following influenza. The rare occurrence of neurological complications after influenza vaccine should not discourage against the vaccination.”

Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome after vaccination in United States: data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/Food and Drug Administration Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (1990-2005).
“There were 1000 cases (mean age, 47 years) of GBS reported after vaccination in the United States between 1990 and 2005. The onset of GBS was within 6 weeks in 774 cases, &gt;6 weeks in 101, and unknown in 125. Death and disability after the event occurred in 32 (3.2%) and 167 (16.7%) subjects, respectively. The highest number (n = 632) of GBS cases was observed in subjects receiving influenza vaccine followed by hepatitis B vaccine (n = 94). Other vaccines or combinations of vaccines were associated with 274 cases of GBS. The incidence of GBS after influenza vaccination was marginally higher in subjects or=65 years (P = 0.09); for hepatitis vaccine, the incidence was significantly higher (P &lt; 0.0001) in the or=65 years compared with those &lt;65 years (P U) in the 5′ non-coding region, which is strongly related to the higher strain virulence.”

Vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis caused by contact infection.
“We encountered an adult patient with acute anterior poliomyelitis (AAP), whose monoparesis developed 28 days after his sonâs immunization with oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV). Neurological and electrophysiological examinations suggested that his muscular wasting of the left lower limb was due to a lower motor neuron disorder, and magnetic resonance imaging revealed the responsible lesion in the left anterior horn at the thoracolumbar junction. His stool was found to include poliovirus type 3, mainly originating from Sabin 3 by neutrization antibody and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. This indicated that the AAP resulted from contact with his son.”

Vaccinia virus in postvaccinal encephalitis.
“Results of virological examination of 239 samples taken from 84 children with neurological complications after smallpox vaccination are described. In postvaccinal encephalitis, vaccinia virus was isolated from blood, cerebrospinal fluid and pharyngeal secretions of 23 out of 40 children (57.5%) as well as from autopsy specimens sampled between 10-35 days after vaccination. During the acute period of disease, virus was detected in 17 out of 31 (54.2%) cerebrospinal fluid specimens. In 3 postvaccinal encephalitis cases the virus was present in brain and in a case of encephalomyelitis-in the spinal cord. These results confirmed the participation of vaccinia virus in the pathogenesis of postvaccinal encephalitis. The pathogenicity of vaccinia virus may be manifested only under a changed reactivity of the vaccinated host.”

                                Ampiginous choroiditis following quadrivalent human papilloma virus vaccine
“A 17-year-old female was referred for new-onset vision loss in both eyes 3 weeks after being vaccinated with the quadrivalent HPV vaccine. A standard dose of 0.5 ml was injected intramuscularly into the left deltoid without any resulting skin reaction. Her medical history was significant for depression treated with quetiapine. Three weeks following vaccination, she developed painless vision loss in the left eye …”

Association of acute cerebellar ataxia and human papilloma virus vaccination: a case report.
“INTRODUCTION: We report the case of a patient who developed symptoms of acute cerebellar ataxia (ACA) after administration of the human papilloma virus (HPV)-16/18 vaccine.
PATIENT AND METHOD: This patient developed symptoms of ACA, including nausea, vertigo, severe limb and truncal ataxia, and bilateral spontaneous continuous horizontal nystagmus with irregular rhythm, 12 days after administration of the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted cervical cancer vaccine. After this, the patient received methylprednisolone pulse and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapies as well as immunoadsorption plasmapheresis.
RESULTS: Severe ACA symptoms did not improve after methylprednisolone pulse and IVIG therapies, but the patient recovered completely after immunoadsorption plasmapheresis.
CONCLUSION: This temporal association strongly suggests that ACA was induced by the vaccination.”

[Differential diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis in subjects with post-immunization reaction].
“An increasingly greater fraction of the general population is getting involved in the immunization program. However, conditions of individual subjects are not always properly evaluated prior to immunization. The clinical case reported below demonstrates the difficulty of diagnostic examination of patients with Graves disease (toxic goiter), endocrine ophthalmopathy, and post-immunization reaction.”

Ocular vaccinia: a consequence of unrecognized contact transmission.2011. 
“A patient developed severe ocular vaccinia via autoinoculation after acquiring unrecognized contact-transmitted vaccinia from wrestling with vaccinated members of his unit. This case highlights both the need to reinforce infection-control measures among vaccinees and the need for providers to be familiar with the identification and treatment of cutaneous and ocular vaccinia infection.”

“We report a case of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) that was noteworthy because optic neuritis (ON) occurred in a very close temporal association with both the first and second HPV vaccinations, which might suggest an association between HPV vaccination and the development of NMO-IgG and recurrent ON.”

Vaccinia keratouveitis manifesting as a masquerade syndrome.
“A patient who used contact lenses and had a history of blunt trauma developed vaccinia keratouveitis after accidental ocular autoinoculation from a recent vaccination site. Corneal and conjunctival cultures were taken for bacteria, fungi, Acanthamoeba, and viruses. Viral-like cytopathic effects became evident in tissue culture within three days. Immunofluorescence studies were negative for varicella-zoster virus, herpes simplex virus, adenovirus, measles, mumps, parainfluenza, and influenza. Pox viral particles were identified in the infected tissue cultures by electron microscopy. The Hind III restriction endonuclease profile of the viral DNA isolate was similar to the Lister strain of vaccinia virus.”

“Acute pancreatitis may result from viral infections, including mumps, coxsackie B, Epstein-Barr, and varicella. However, viral pancreatitis has not been reported after immunization with viral vaccines. We report the occurrence of acute pancreatitis in an adult who had received measles, mumps, and rubella II vaccine (MMR II).”

ANTIRABIES ANTIBODY RESPONSE IN MAN TO VACCINE MADE FROM INFECTED SUCKLING-MOUSE BRAINS.
“Antirabies vaccines produced from infected brains of adult mammals have always had the potentiality of causing post-vaccinal paralysis or allergic encephalitis in man. Attempts in recent years either to remove the paralytic factor from brain-tissue vaccines or to use as the virus source infected tissue other than nervous tissue (e.g., chick embryos) have usually resulted in a substantial reduction of the specific antirabies potency.”

The clinical course resulted in nearly complete paralysis of the lower limbs, paresis of the upper limbs and partial involvement of the cranial nerves. There was only slight sensory loss. The CSF revealed no pleocytosis and a protein level of 206 mg/100 ml. Recovery began 2 weeks later and was almost complete after 2 months. Immunological investigations revealed no remarkable changes.”

Characteristics of poliovirus strains from long-term excretors with primary immunodeficiencies.
“Individuals who are deficient in humoral immunity are particularly at risk from infection with enteroviruses, and poliovirus in particular, where antibodies are the main source of protection from disease. Long-term excretion of vaccine strains of poliovirus has been documented for many years and instances of paralytic poliomyelitis in hypogammaglobulinaemic patients who were subsequently found to have been excreting virus for prolonged periods have been reported in the U.S.A., Germany and Japan. The identification of a healthy immunodeficient patient in the U.K. who has probably been excreting type 2 poliovirus for 15 years will be described, with the characteristics of the virus and the results of attempts at treatment so far. Such individuals pose a significant risk to the eradication programme unless they can be identified and treated.”

ð Estimating the extent of vaccine-derived poliovirus infection.
“Eight outbreaks of paralytic polio attributable to circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) have highlighted the risks associated with oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) use in areas of low vaccination coverage and poor hygiene.” 
“Although only 114 virologically-confirmed paralytic cases were identified in the eight cVDPV outbreaks, it is likely that a minimum of hundreds of thousands, and more likely several million individuals were infected during these events, and that many thousands more have been infected by VDPV lineages within outbreaks which have escaped detection.

Guillain - Barreâ syndrome following recombinant hepatitis B vaccine and literature review.
“A 17 year-old woman developed progressive quadriparesis with bilateral facial diplegia after immunization with recombinant hepatitis B vaccine 3 days prior. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed acellular fluid with high protein level. The electrodiagnosis was compatible with demyelinating polyneuropathy. Other potential causes of Guillain-Barreâ syndrome (GBS) were ruled out. Her motor power gradually improved and returned to normal later. The temporal relationship between GBS and vaccination was suggestive of a vaccine-induced cause. Mechanisms of this very rare complication are proposed with a literature review.”

ð Imported Vaccine-Associated Paralytic Poliomyelitis — United States, 2005
“This report describes the first known occurrence of imported VAPP in an unvaccinated U.S. adult who traveled abroad, where she likely was exposed through contact with an infant recently vaccinated with OPV.”
“Upon admission to a hospital in Phoenix, the patient had bilateral areflexic lower extremity weakness and respiratory failure requiring intubation.”
“The host familyâs son and daughter-in-law lived next door with two children, aged 2 months and 3 years, who visited the host family frequently. The infant received his first dose of OPV on January 19, 2005, 4 days after the woman arrived to live with the host family.”

ð LESSONS FROM THE SALK POLIO VACCINE: METHODS FOR AND RISKS OF RAPID TRANSLATION
“Regretfully, the story of polio vaccine was not without tragedy. In April 1955, soon after mass polio vaccination began in the United States, reports trickled in to the Surgeon General concerning atypical cases of paralytic polio. Several paralytic polio cases were reported in California in patients who had received the polio vaccine about a week earlier but the paralysis only affected the arm or leg in which they received the injection. Each of these cases occurred in polio vaccine produced by Cutter pharmaceutical company. The Surgeon General immediately pulled all Cutter polio vaccine, but it was too late; nearly 400,000 children had been inoculated with Cutter polio vaccine and 250 cases of atypical paralytic polio occurred. There were also reports of the Wyeth pharmaceutical company polio vaccine causing paralysis and death in several children in the northeastern United States.
It was soon discovered that some lots of Cutter and Wyeth polio vaccine were insufficiently inactivated with formalin leading to live polio virus in more than 100,000 doses. In fact, 16 lots of Cutter polio vaccine were retested and the first 6 lots produced were positive for live polio virus. These incidents demonstrated the lack of oversight and safeguards put into place before the vaccine was made so widely available.”

MRI findings in an infant with vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis.
“We report a Brazilian infant who developed VAPP 40 days after receiving the first dose of oral polio vaccine (OPV). MR images of the cervical and thoracic spinal cord showed lesions involving the anterior horn cell, with increased signal intensity on T2-weighted sequences. We would like to emphasize the importance of considering VAPP as a differential diagnosis in patients with acute flaccid paralysis and an MRI showing involvement of medulla oblongata or spinal cord, particularly in countries where OPV is extensively administered.”

Outbreak of poliomyelitis in Hispaniola associated with circulating type 1 vaccine-derived poliovirus.
“An outbreak of paralytic poliomyelitis occurred in the Dominican Republic (13 confirmed cases) and Haiti (8 confirmed cases, including 2 fatal cases) during 2000-2001. All but one of the patients were either unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated children, and cases occurred in communities with very low (7 to 40%) rates of coverage with oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV). The outbreak was associated with the circulation of a derivative of the type 1 OPV strain, probably originating from a single OPV dose given in 1998-1999. The vaccine-derived poliovirus associated with the outbreak had biological properties indistinguishable from those of wild poliovirus.”

Poliomyelitis Associated With Type 2 Virus
Paralytic Disease in the Father of a Recently Immunized Child
“Paralytic poliomyelitis was diagnosed clinically in a 29-year-old man three weeks after his 2-year-old son received trivalent live oral poliovirus vaccine. Type 2 poliovirus with “vaccine-like” characteristics was isolated from the patientâs stool, and the serum showed a significant rise in neutralizing antibody against type 2 virus. There was no rise in complement fixation antibody titers. The patients illness was likely due to type 2 poliovirus contracted from his son. Physicians should inquire about the immunization status of parents before administering vaccine to children.”

Sudden hearing loss after rabies vaccination.
“BACKGROUND: Sudden hearing loss developing after immunisation is a very rare situation. Rabies is a viral disease characterised by encephalitis and death. Treatment involves active and passive immunisation. Neurologic complications including Guillain-Barre syndrome or facial paralysis are reported in the literature as a side effect after rabies immunisation.
CASE REPORT: Sudden hearing loss was detected in an 11 year-old male patient who had taken the medication for rabies immunisation.
CONCLUSION: This study presents a case report of sudden hearing loss developing after rabies immunisation - no other aetiological factors were detected and clinical management is discussed in light of the literature.”

Use of a novel real-time PCR assay to detect oral polio vaccine shedding and reversion in stool and sewage samples after a mexican national immunization day.
“During replication, oral polio vaccine (OPV) can revert to neurovirulence and cause paralytic poliomyelitis. In individual vaccinees, it can acquire specific revertant point mutations, leading to vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP). With longer replication, OPV can mutate into vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV), which causes poliomyelitis outbreaks similar to those caused by wild poliovirus. After wild poliovirus eradication, safely phasing out vaccination will likely require global use of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) until cessation of OPV circulation.”

Vaccine-associated contact paralytic poliomyelitis with atypical neurological presentation.
“Paralytic poliomyelitis presenting with quadriparesis, transient encephalitis and bulbar symptoms in 2 patients in close contact with recently vaccinated children with trivalent live oral polio vaccine is described. Symmetrical lower motor neuron involvement of deltoid muscles with electromyographic confirmation was found. Upper motor neuron signs, with symmetrical hyperactive deep tendon reflexes developed in the lower extremities. Poliovirus Type-2 vaccine-like strain was cultured from one patient and both patients showed significant antibody titers rises to poliovirus. Attention is drawn to the possible clinical differences between vaccine associated poliomelitis and the usual features found in wild strain poliomyelitis. It is suggested that in selected cases, non-immunized contacts be given inactivated polio-vaccine when the vaccinees are immunized with the live oral-vaccine.”

Vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis caused by contact infection.
“We encountered an adult patient with acute anterior poliomyelitis (AAP), whose monoparesis developed 28 days after his sonâs immunization with oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV). Neurological and electrophysiological examinations suggested that his muscular wasting of the left lower limb was due to a lower motor neuron disorder, and magnetic resonance imaging revealed the responsible lesion in the left anterior horn at the thoracolumbar junction. His stool was found to include poliovirus type 3, mainly originating from Sabin 3 by neutrization antibody and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. This indicated that the AAP resulted from contact with his son.”

                                Acute Onset of Parkinsonism With Reversible Course After H1N1 Vaccination: Insight From a Young Lady
“To the Editor: Parkinsonian symptoms can be induced by acute encephalitis, syphilis, malaria, poliomyelitis, and sudden carbon monoxide poisoning.1,2 In this report, a 17-year-old girl had Parkinson’s disease (PD) symptoms after a flu shot. So far, this is the first vaccine-related disorder that mimics PD. Our experience has shown that some parkinsonism can be cured with accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.”

Idiopathic Parkinson’s disease(s) may follow subclinical episodes of perivenous demyelination.
“Three case studies of postvaccinal parkinsonism (PVP) demonstrated signs and symptoms identical to conventional diagnostic standards of idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (PD). PVP is a sub-type of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADE) that also includes postinfectious parkinsonism (PIP) and postinfectious encephalomyelitis (PIE).”

Postvaccinal parkinsonism.
“A 5-year-old boy, with a history of fever beginning 15 days after a vaccination for measles, developed a rigid-akinetic syndrome 3 days after the fever began. A spinal tap obtained 1 week after the onset of fever showed pleocytosis with a monocellular pattern. A CT scan of the head and EEG did not disclose any abnormality. An MRI performed 3 months after the event, however, showed clear-cut evidence of bilateral substantia nigra lesions, suggesting secondary gliosis. The response to levodopa was good, but adverse reactions appeared early. The child is now 7 years old. Bromocriptine, deprenyl, and levodopa have produced a remarkable improvement of the parkinsonian features.”

🛑 [Complications of pertussis immunization (author transl)].
“16 cases of neurological disease and/or death shortly after pertussis immunization are reported. Eight patients had convulsions, six with ensuing permanent defects. Severe polymyositis was observed in one case. Five infants died 12 h to 4 days after vaccination: two after acute encephalopathy and three in the form of a sudden unexpected death (SID). In two fatal cases the morphological changes in the brain corresponded to those of pertussis encephalopathy: neuronal degeneration in various parts of the cortex, especially in the region of the ammons horn, and in the cerebellum. There were no signs of inflammation. Three cases underwent forensic autopsy and death was attributed to bronchopulmonary infection. Complete neuropathological work-up was only done in one case, in which the brain was normal. The critique of episodical reports and the demand for prospective studies is appreciated. Knowledge of all possible forms of complications, however, is indispensable for future investigations. Polymyositis and SID have so far not been listed as abnormal reactions to immunization. The majority of our cases became known accidentally from hospital sheets or from discussions with collegues. For a detection of all possible cases a greater awareness of doctors for the problem of pertussis immunization appears necessary. Only another 23 cases have been reported to the health authorities of the state of Lower Saxony during the last 6 to 7 years. Of those, nine were either harmless reactions or diseases probably unrelated to vaccination. Two were cases of SID, 12 and 72 h after vaccination. It is concluded that only a minor proportion of possible complications is presently reported to the health authorities.”

“At its peak, siblings were the most important sources of pertussis in infants 6 months and younger, particularly fully vaccinated children aged 2 and 3 years. Waning immunity before the booster at 4 years may leave this age group susceptible to infection.”

Gulf war syndrome: could it be triggered by biological warfare-vaccines using pertussis as an adjuvant?
“Several recent epidemiological studies have shown that vaccinations against biological warfare using pertussis as an adjuvant were associated with the Gulf war syndrome. If such epidemiological findings are confirmed, we propose that the use of pertussis as an adjuvant could trigger neurodegeneration through induction of interleukin-1beta secretion in the brain. In turn, neuronal lesions may be sustained by stress or neurotoxic chemical combinations. Particular susceptibility for IL-1beta secretion and potential distant neuronal damage could provide an explanation for the diversity of the symptoms observed on veterans.”

Hypotonic hyporesponsive episode and the 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine.
“Hypotensive-hyporesponsive episodes are rare events after immunizations performed for diphtheria, tetanus, Haemophilus influenzae type b and hepatitis B virus vaccines, but most of the reported episodes have been associated with pertussis-containing vaccines. We report the case of a 3-month-old girl, previously healthy otherwise, presenting with the unusual event of a hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode after vaccination with the 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine. Diagnosis was established after a thorough evaluation of the patient and by exclusion of other clinical conditions.” 
Note: “A hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode (HHE) is a sudden and unexpected episode of loss of tone, unresponsiveness and colour change which uncommonly affects infants and children after vaccination.” – MS Gold, PubMed

[Neurologic manifestations following pertussis vaccination].
“Twenty cases of acute neurological complications occuring within 7 days of pertussis immunization are reported. Convulsions were present in every case and status epilepticus was observed in five infants. In only 4 cases were neurological or epileptic sequelae lacking. The clustering of neurological complications in the 24 hours following immunization is not consistent with the hypothesis of a mere temporal coincidence. However, the mechanism and incidence of post-immunization encephalopathies remains obscure and epidemiological studies are in order.”

Outbreak of pertussis in highly immunized adolescents and its secondary spread to their families.
“An outbreak of pertussis was recognized in a highly immunized sixth-grade class of schoolchildren. Among 43 children aged 11-12 years in the class, 38 had been immunized with three doses or more of DTP containing whole-cell pertussis vaccine, two with two doses of DTP and three children were unimmunized. The last DTP vaccines had been given 6-10 years before the outbreak. A total of eight children with pertussis suffering paroxysmal coughing attacks for 3 weeks or more were identified, seven being fully immunized and one unimmunized. Among the eight cases, two were confirmed by both culture and serology and one by serology alone. The attack rate in fully immunized children was 18.4% (7/38). Secondary spread of pertussis was identified in five of the households from which the eight patients originated. A total of six cases of pertussis from these five households were identified, and two of these were culture-confirmed. These observations suggest that vaccine-induced immunity weakens considerably 6-10 years after vaccination, and that booster immunization with DTP instead of DT is therefore recommended for the control of pertussis.”

🛑 Pertussis adjuvant prolongs intestinal hypersensitivity.
“CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate nanogram quantities of PT, when administered with a food protein, result in long-term sensitization to the antigen, and altered intestinal neuroimmune function. These data suggest that exposure to bacterial pathogens may prolong the normally transient immune responsiveness to inert food antigens.”

Revisiting the possibility of serious adverse events from the whole cell pertussis vaccine: were metabolically vulnerable children at risk?
“In the early 1980’s concerns about the safety of the whole cell pertussis vaccine in the United States resulted in declining vaccination rates and the withdrawal of multiple vaccine providers from the market. While the possibility of inflammation and febrile reactions to the vaccine were acknowledged by public health authorities, parents also claimed the vaccine was associated with sudden infant death syndrome and encephalopathy. Epidemiological studies examining this question, however, consistently failed to identify an association. We argue that these reactions may have occurred in metabolically vulnerable children, specifically those with defects in fatty acid oxidation. In these children the combination of anorexia and fever that could be caused by the vaccine may have resulted in hypoglycemic episodes and possibly death. We believe that this association was not detected because these conditions were not recognized at the time and because these conditions are uncommon. Nevertheless, at a population level, enough events could have occurred to cause concern amongst parents.”

                                Hypotonic hyporesponsive episode and the 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine.
“Hypotensive-hyporesponsive episodes are rare events after immunizations performed for diphtheria, tetanus, Haemophilus influenzae type b and hepatitis B virus vaccines, but most of the reported episodes have been associated with pertussis-containing vaccines. We report the case of a 3-month-old girl, previously healthy otherwise, presenting with the unusual event of a hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode after vaccination with the 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine. Diagnosis was established after a thorough evaluation of the patient and by exclusion of other clinical conditions.” 
Note: “A hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode (HHE) is a sudden and unexpected episode of loss of tone, unresponsiveness and colour change which uncommonly affects infants and children after vaccination.” – MS Gold, PubMed

🛑 Hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode in a 7-month-old infant after receipt of multiple vaccinations.
“A 7-month-old boy became difficult to arouse, was limp and had blue extremities 8 hours after immunization with intravenous poliovirus, diphtheria-tetanus toxoids-acellular pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae type b-hepatitis B virus and pneumococcal vaccines. The hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode had resolved by the time the infant was seen in an emergency department 1 hour later. The report describes hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode, encourages reporting of vaccine-associated adverse events and discusses prognosis and implications for subsequent immunization.”

Pneumococcal vaccine failure: can it be a primary immunodeficiency?
“We present the case of a 4-year-old boy, with complete antipneumococcal vaccination, who had necrotising pneumonia with pleural effusion and severe pancytopaenia with need for transfusion. A vaccine-serotype Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated in the blood culture. On follow-up, detailed medical history, laboratory and genetic investigation led to the diagnosis of X linked dyskeratosis congenita.”

[Post-licensure safety surveillance for Prevenar 13(®) in France].
“RESULTS: In 4 years and 4 months, 376 AEs, including 252 severe (67%), were recorded, 83 of which occurred following an injection of Prevenar 13(®) alone: 39 cutaneous AEs, 16 neurological AEs, four cases of collapse or shock, nine cases of fever, and one of thrombocytopenia. For the serious AEs, the outcome was favorable in 88% of cases and none of the 12 reported deaths were attributed to a side effect of vaccination. Fifty-nine cases of pneumococcal disease that suggest an ineffective vaccine were reported, but only 16 can be considered as a real failure of the vaccination.”

Preparation for global introduction of inactivated poliovirus vaccine: safety evidence from the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, 2000-12.
“Of the 41,792 adverse event reports submitted, 39,568 (95%) were for children younger than 7 years. 38,381 of the reports for children in this age group (97%) were for simultaneous vaccination with IPV and other vaccines (most commonly pneumococcal and acellular pertussis vaccines), whereas standalone IPV vaccines accounted for 0·5% of all reports. 34,880 reports were for non-serious events (88%), 3905 reports were for non-fatal serious events (10%), and 783 reports were death reports (2%). Injection-site erythema was the most commonly coded term for non-serious events (29%), and pyrexia for non-fatal serious events (38%). Most deaths (96%) were in children aged 12 months or younger; most (52%) had sudden infant death syndrome as the reported cause of death.”

Vaccine Failures in Patients Properly Vaccinated with 13-Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine in Catalonia, a Region with Low Vaccination Coverage.
“Vaccine failures occurring with 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in 3 pediatric hospitals in Barcelona (2012-2013) are described. PCV13 vaccine failure was defined as the occurrence of an invasive pneumococcal infection in children properly vaccinated by PCV13. Among 84 patients with invasive pneumococcal infection, 32 had received at least one dose of PCV13. Seventeen of them had invasive pneumococcal infection produced by a PCV13 serotype. Among those, 9 patients were considered to have a PCV13 vaccine failure. Serotype 3 was isolated in 6 patients, serotype 19A in 2 and serotype 6B in 1.”

Mycobacterium bovis lymphadenitis complicating BCG immunization in an infant with symptomatic HIV-1 infection.
“A 3-month-old infant with HIV-1 infection who recently immigrated from Ethiopia developed regional lymphadenitis and systemic symptoms subsequent to BCG immunization. She was suffering from axillary lymphadenitis ipsilateral to the BCG vaccination site, failure to thrive, unresolving fever and hepatosplenomegaly. Acid-fast bacilli were seen on staining and Mycobacterium bovis was isolated from the regional lymph node. The infant responded promptly to triple antituberculous therapy but died 2 months later from overwhelming pneumonia and respiratory failure. This case emphasizes the iatrogenic hazards of BCG immunization in HIV-1 infected infants. With the increasing prevalence of pediatric HIV-1 infection, indiscriminate BCG immunization programs should be reconsidered. While infants with asymptomatic HIV-1 infection at risk for tuberculosis should be immunized, BCG immunization should be withheld in those with symptomatic disease.”

                                Abortive and subclinical poliomyelitis in a family during the 1992 epidemic in The Netherlands.
“We describe a case of abortive poliomyelitis due to poliovirus type 3 (PV3) in an unvaccinated woman and a subclinical poliovirus infection in her family during an epidemic in the Netherlands. The woman excreted the epidemic strain (PV3) for 7 weeks. Her two children received oral attenuated poliovirus vaccine and were subsequently found to excrete PV1 and PV2 vaccine strains in addition to the epidemic PV3 strain. Her husband, who had neutralizing antibodies to all three poliovirus types because of previous vaccination, initially excreted no virus; subsequently, however, the vaccine strain PV1 and the epidemic strain PV3 could be cultured from his feces.”

Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis associated with oral polio vaccine.
“A 27-year-old woman presented with acute paresis after taking an oral polio vaccine (OPV). Deep tendon reflexes were preserved, needle electromyography showed no neurogenic changes, and there were no lesions on spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), suggesting that motor neurons of the spinal cord were not affected. Brain MRI showed abnormal lesions in the tegmentum of the upper pons, left cerebral peduncles, truncus of the corpus callosum, and right parietal lobe. Cerebrospinal fluid revealed mild pleocytosis. The most probable diagnosis was acute disseminated encephalomyelitis associated with OPV.”

ð Adverse events associated with childhood vaccines other than pertussis and rubella. Summary of a report from the Institute of Medicine.Â 
“The committee found that the evidence favored acceptance of a causal relation between diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome and brachial neuritis, between measles vaccine and anaphylaxis, between oral polio vaccine and Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome, and between unconjugated Hib vaccine and susceptibility to Hib disease. The committee found that the evidence established causality between diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and anaphylaxis, between measles vaccine and death from measles vaccine-strain viral infection, between measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and thrombocytopenia and anaphylaxis, between oral polio vaccine and poliomyelitis and death from polio vaccine-strain viral infection, and between hepatitis B vaccine and anaphylaxis.”

The African polio vaccine-acquired immune deficiency syndrome connection.
“Seroepidemiological, clinical and molecular findings suggest that the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus human immunodeficiency virus-1 was introduced into the human species at the time (late 1950s) and in the geographic area (Zaire) in which millions of Africans were vaccinated with attenuated poliomyelitis virus strains that were produced in kidney tissue obtained from monkeys. Since monkeys not only harbor viruses that are remarkably similar to and genetically related to human immunodeficiency virus-1, but also served as tissue donors for the African polio vaccine, it is reasonable to suspect that a then non-detectable monkey virus with human-1-like properties was unknowingly co-cultured with the attenuated poliovirus virus and subsequently administered to the vaccinees. The possibility of such a polio vaccine-acquired immune deficiency syndrome connection is a reminder of the unpredictable danger of artifically crossing natural species-barriers in biomedical laboratories.”

ð Assessment of iatrogenic transmission of HCV in Southern Italy: was the cause the Salk polio vaccination?Â 
“Since the first studies on hepatitis C virus (HCV) prevalence were published, it has been evident that southern Italy is an area of hyperendemicity. A recent study conducted in southern Italy suggested that the high prevalence of HCV infection might be the result of past iatrogenic transmission. Polio vaccination with the parenteral Salk vaccine between 1956 and 1965 by multiple use of unsafe glass syringes may have been one of the major causes of the spread of HCV infection among southern Italian adults who are now older than 40 years of age. Persons born between the 1940s and early 1960s have a nearly 3-fold increased risk of HCV seropositivity than the younger age group. The findings are consistent with a cohort effect of exposure to the Salk parenteral vaccination.”

“Millions of people worldwide were inadvertently exposed to live simian virus 40 (SV40) between 1955 and 1963 through immunization with SV40-contaminated polio vaccines. Although the prevalence of SV40 infections in humans is not known, numerous studies suggest that SV40 is a pathogen resident in the human population today. SV40 is a potent DNA tumor virus that is known to induce primary brain cancers, bone cancers, mesotheliomas, and lymphomas in laboratory animals.”

Bridging the gap: human diploid cell strains and the origin of AIDS.
“Although the theory of a chimpanzee origin of HIV-1 with cross-species transfer to man has now gained popularity, a more likely scenario is that chimps and humans were infected by an HIV-1 precursor virus derived from a contaminated poliovaccine. The reason for the rapidity and ease of cross-species transfer of this precursor virus has not been elucidated. We hypothesize that the poliovaccine was passaged in a human diploid cell strain.”

Characteristics of poliovirus strains from long-term excretors with primary immunodeficiencies.
“Individuals who are deficient in humoral immunity are particularly at risk from infection with enteroviruses, and poliovirus in particular, where antibodies are the main source of protection from disease. Long-term excretion of vaccine strains of poliovirus has been documented for many years and instances of paralytic poliomyelitis in hypogammaglobulinaemic patients who were subsequently found to have been excreting virus for prolonged periods have been reported in the U.S.A., Germany and Japan. The identification of a healthy immunodeficient patient in the U.K. who has probably been excreting type 2 poliovirus for 15 years will be described, with the characteristics of the virus and the results of attempts at treatment so far. Such individuals pose a significant risk to the eradication programme unless they can be identified and treated.”

Donât ignore the risk of vaccine contamination
“Sir, Your News and Opinion articles about alleged contamination of vaccines should serve as a warning against over-optimism.
These articles highlight the failure to show any evidence for contamination of Wistar Institute polio vaccine stocks by human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV/SIV), and you appeal for a truce. But â although Edward Hooper is quoted as saying that “vaccine samples released did not include any from batches prepared for use in Africa” â lymphocytes have been detected in other polio vaccines. Half of the vervet monkeys in Southern Africa are SIV positive; these animals were used for preparing early polio vaccines.
Considering the many millions of vaccine doses prepared in primary vervet monkey kidney cultures over a 30-year period, it is inconceivable that some SIV did not contaminate many cultures. By the same yardstick, simian virus 40 (SV40) contaminated millions of doses of poliovirus vaccine until the animals were screened for this tumour virus.
Edward Hooper and others surely do not intend to undermine the polio vaccine efforts. What is needed is a new awareness of the need for caution â remembering the example of BSE â in view of the current impetus towards xenotransplantation and the accompanying danger of contamination. Our aim should be to improve our vaccines, not to undermine public confidence in them.”

Effect of prior immunity on the shedding of virulent revertant virus in feces after oral immunization with live attenuated poliovirus vaccines.
“Groups of infants were immunized with one or two doses of orally inoculated live attenuated Sabin poliovirus vaccine (OPV group) or with one or two doses of enhanced-potency inactivated poliovirus vaccine (EIPV) administered parenterally followed by one or two doses of OPV (EIPV-OPV group). The fecal specimens from both groups were tested for poliovirus shedding 1-2 months after OPV. The virus isolates were examined for nucleic acid sequences in the 5′ noncoding regions (bases 480, 481, and 472 for serotypes 1, 2, and 3, respectively) to determine whether the viruses shed represented nonattenuated revertants, attenuated parent vaccine strains (nonrevertants), or both. In the OPV group, 4 of the 6 virus isolates recovered 30-60 days after the first immunization dose and 1 of the 3 isolates obtained after the second dose were found to be nonrevertants (parent vaccine strain). In contrast, 11 of the 12 isolates in the EIPV-OPV group were of the nonvaccine revertant virus types. The frequency for reversion appeared to differ for different poliovirus serotypes. However, all revertant type 3 isolates were recovered from subjects previously immunized with EIPV.”

ð Estimating the extent of vaccine-derived poliovirus infection.
“Eight outbreaks of paralytic polio attributable to circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) have highlighted the risks associated with oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) use in areas of low vaccination coverage and poor hygiene.” 
“Although only 114 virologically-confirmed paralytic cases were identified in the eight cVDPV outbreaks, it is likely that a minimum of hundreds of thousands, and more likely several million individuals were infected during these events, and that many thousands more have been infected by VDPV lineages within outbreaks which have escaped detection.”

Estimating the risk of re-emergence after stopping polio vaccination.
“As vaccinated hosts are natural reservoirs for virulent poliovirus, the source of the risk is the vaccination itself, employed to prevent the outbreaks.” 
“Our estimates for transmission, recovery, and mutation rates, show that the probability of an outbreak of vaccine-derived virulent viruses easily exceeds 90%. Moreover, if a small fraction of hosts have a longer infectious period, as observed in individuals with innate immunodeficiency, the risk of an outbreak rises significantly.”

Estimation of polio infection prevalence from environmental surveillance data. 2017 
“By measuring virus shed into sewage waste in cities in which a known number of people received a live polio vaccine, the authors created tools that can be used to monitor polio incidence in other cities. Thus, virus levels in sewage waste can give an early warning of the reappearance of viral disease or verify its absence.”
“Data from the intersecting population between the two data sets (covering more than 63,000 people) yielded a dose-dependent relationship between the number of poliovirus shedders and the amount of poliovirus in sewage.

ð Experimental oral polio vaccines and acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
The simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) of the common chimpanzee is widely acknowledged as the direct ancestor of HIV-1. There is increasing historical evidence that during the late 1950s, kidneys were routinely excised from central African chimpanzees by scientists who were collaborating with the polio vaccine research of Dr Hilary Koprowski, and sent - inter alia - to vaccine-making laboratories in the USA and Africa, and to unspecified destinations in Belgium. While there is no direct evidence that cells from these kidneys were used as a substrate for growing Dr Koprowskiâs oral polio vaccines, there is a startling coincidence between places in Africa where his CHAT vaccine was fed, and the first appearances in the world of HIV-1 group M and group-M-related AIDS. Because of the enormous implications of the hypothesis that AIDS may be an unintended iatrogenic (physician-caused) disease, it is almost inevitable that this theory will engender heated opposition from many of those in the scientific establishment, and those with vested interests.

Fetal damage after accidental polio vaccination of an immune mother.
“Irreparable damage to the anterior horn cells of the cervical and thoracic cord was found in a 20-week-old fetus whose mother was immune to poliomyelitis before conceiving but who was inadvertently given oral polio vaccine at 18 weeks gestation. Polio neutralizing antibody titres in sera, taken before and after pregnancy, were identical and were at levels normally regarded as providing protection. Unsuccessful attempts were made to isolate poliovirus from extracts of fetal brain, lung, liver and placenta. Fluorescent antibody tests were performed on various levels of the central nervous system and on the left and right extensor forearm muscles. Specific positive fluorescence to poliovirus 2 and 3 antigens was detected at dorsal spinal cord level only. One positive result was seen with Coxsackie A9 antiserum and fresh guinea-pig complement in the inflammatory cells in the right extensor forearm muscles.This experience, as yet unexplained, underlines the importance of ensuring that women are not pregnant prior to oral polio vaccination.”

ð Fetal tissue research: an ongoing story of professionally responsible success.Â 
“Research using fetal tissue has allowed for development of vaccines for numerous diseases including polio, rubella, and measles.”
“These scientific and medical advances are dependent on the use of fetal tissue from aborted fetuses. While the practice of induced abortion despite societal benefit may be theologically objectionable to some, these practices are professionally responsible. Federal regulations exist to discourage patients from being influenced by the societal benefit of fetal research in arriving at the decision to terminate as well as to prevent researchers from influencing a patientâs decision.”

Gastrointestinal immunopathology and food allergy.
“In contrast to the beneficial expressions of gastrointestinal-associated lymphoid tissue, which are seen with relevance to newer methods of delivery of vaccines directly applied to the gastrointestinal mucosal surfaces (eg, oral poliovirus, rotavirus, Salmonella typhi vaccines), the adverse consequences of a mucosal immune response gone astray are evidenced in many diseases such as FA. A classification of clinical disorders associated with FA based on classic mechanisms of immunologic injury is presented, which includes the following: (1) IgE-mediated, (2) non-IgE-mediated, and (3) mixed IgE- and non-IgE-mediated disorders. Our study of immunologic disturbance in patients with non-IgE FA revealed a pattern of increased CD4+ and decreased TH1 cell counts in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in contrast to patients with celiac disease, where a pattern of increased CD8+ and TH1 cell counts in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and increased CD8+ cell counts was seen.”

Guillain-Barre syndrome occurring after rabies vaccination.
“A variety of events are associated with the onset of Guillain-Barre syndrome, including vaccinations and vaccines. These are the swine influenza vaccine, oral poliovirus vaccine and rabies vaccine. Rabies is a uniformly fatal disease. It is preventable if World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for post exposure treatment (PET) are followed. These include local treatment of wound, passive immunization with rabies immunoglobulins and administration of a efficacious vaccine. Cell culture vaccines are highly immunogenic with fewer side effects, but are costly. For that reason neurotissue vaccines are still widely used in Pakistan, although they are less immunogenic with higher incidence of neuroparalytic complications. We report a case of Guillain-Barre syndrome secondary to sheep brain anti-rabies vaccine in a young boy, who presented with lower limb weakness with total recovery after treatment.”

Human and animal vaccine contaminations.
“However, since vaccine preparation involves the use of materials of biological origin, vaccines are subject to contamination by micro-organisms. In fact, vaccine contamination has occurred; a historical example of vaccine contamination, for example, can be found in the early days of development of the smallpox vaccine. The introduction of new techniques of vaccine virus production on cell cultures has lead to safer vaccines, but has not completely removed the risk of virus contamination. There are several examples of vaccine contamination, for example, contamination of human vaccines against poliomyelitis byÂ SV40Â virus from the use of monkey primary renal cells. Several veterinary vaccines have been contaminated by pestiviruses from foetal calf serum. These incidents have lead industry to change certain practices and regulatory authorities to develop more stringent and detailed requirements. But the increasing number of target species for vaccines, the diversity of the origin of biological materials and the extremely high number of known and unknown viruses and their constant evolution represent a challenge to vaccine producers and regulatory authorities.”

In April 1955, soon after mass polio vaccination began in the United States, reports trickled in to the Surgeon General concerning atypical cases of paralytic polio. Several paralytic polio cases were reported in California in patients who had received the polio vaccine about a week earlier but the paralysis only affected the arm or leg in which they received the injection. Each of these cases occurred in polio vaccine produced by Cutter pharmaceutical company. The Surgeon General immediately pulled all Cutter polio vaccine, but it was too late; nearly 400,000 children had been inoculated with Cutter polio vaccine and 250 cases of atypical paralytic polio occurred. There were also reports of the Wyeth pharmaceutical company polio vaccine causing paralysis and death in several children in the northeastern United States.
It was soon discovered that some lots of Cutter and Wyeth polio vaccine were insufficiently inactivated with formalin leading to live polio virus in more than 100,000 doses. In fact, 16 lots of Cutter polio vaccine were retested and the first 6 lots produced were positive for live polio virus. These incidents demonstrated the lack of oversight and safeguards put into place before the vaccine was made so widely available.”

Live oral poliovirus vaccines and simian cytomegalovirus.
“Live oral poliovirus vaccines (OPV) are often produced in primary Cercopithecus monkey kidney (CMK) cells. The kidneys of these monkeys are often latently infected with simian cytomegalovirus (SCMV), and CMK cultures are frequently contaminated with SCMV. We tested human, monkey and rabbit tissue culture systems, and found that MRC-5 cells are most sensitive for detection of SCMV. To address the question of whether OPV could be contaminated with infectious SCMV, we inoculated MRC-5 cells with neutralized OPV manufactured in the United States between 1972 and 1998. Infectious SCMV was not found in any of the vaccine lots tested. We also used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to search for SCMV DNA in live oral poliovirus vaccines; SCMV DNA sequences were found in several of the vaccine lots manufactured prior to 1992.”

MR images of the cervical and thoracic spinal cord showed lesions involving the anterior horn cell, with increased signal intensity on T2-weighted sequences. We would like to emphasize the importance of considering VAPP as a differential diagnosis in patients with acute flaccid paralysis and an MRI showing involvement of medulla oblongata or spinal cord, particularly in countries where OPV is extensively administered.”

Neuropathology of vaccination in infants and children.
“AIMS: Documentation of clinical-pathological features of 37 infants/children whose parents alleged a relationship between vaccination and death or permanent central nervous system (CNS) damage, and sought compensation through the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.
SCOPE: Of the 5545 claims filed during the 10-year period (1990-1999), CNS tissue was available for evaluation by a pediatric neuropathologist in 37; 33 died and 4 had a biopsy or lobectomy. Most commonly implicated vaccines were DTP/DTaP, followed by MMR and IPV/OPV, but almost all ofÂ the vaccinesÂ currently given to infants/children were alleged to be responsible for the illness/death. No lesions were found in 5 of 37 (13.5%). The most frequent abnormality consisted of acute anoxic encephalopathy (14 of 37 - 37.8%), consequent to several different causes, such as positional asphyxia, cardio-respiratory arrest during status epilepticus, etc. The remaining children manifested other lesions, including inflammation (5 of 37 - 13.5%), vascular and developmental anomalies (4 each of 37 or 10.6%), cerebral edema and system degeneration (2 each of 37 or 5.4%), and one case of heavy metal exposure in a child living near an abandoned mine (2.2%).”

ð Oral polio vaccine and human cancer: a reassessment ofÂ SV40Â as a contaminant based upon legal documents.Â 
“The confirmation of the removal by one drug manufacturer, Lederle, has been made public at an international symposium in January 1997, where its representatives stated that all of Lederleâs seeds had been tested and screened to assure that it was free fromÂ SV40Â virus. However, in litigation involving the Lederle oral polio vaccine, the manufacturerâs internal documents failed to reveal such removal in all of the seeds. The absence of confirmatory testing of the seeds, as well as testimony of a Lederle manager, indicate that this claim of removal ofÂ SV40Â and the testing forÂ SV40Â in all the seeds cannot be fully substantiated. These legal documents and testimony indicate that the scientific community should not be content with prior assumptions thatÂ SV40Â could not have been in the oral polio vaccine.”

“Of the 41,792 adverse event reports submitted, 39,568 (95%) were for children younger than 7 years. 38,381 of the reports for children in this age group (97%) were for simultaneous vaccination with IPV and other vaccines (most commonly pneumococcal and acellular pertussis vaccines), whereas standalone IPV vaccines accounted for 0Â·5% of all reports. 34,880 reports were for non-serious events (88%), 3905 reports were for non-fatal serious events (10%), and 783 reports were death reports (2%). Injection-site erythema was the most commonly coded term for non-serious events (29%), and pyrexia for non-fatal serious events (38%). Most deaths (96%) were in children aged 12 months or younger; most (52%) had sudden infant death syndrome as the reported cause of death.”

Prevalence of vaccine-derived polioviruses in stools of immunodeficient children in South Africa.
“Prolonged excretion of PVs by immunodeficient individuals is of major concern, because continued replication of PVs in the human gut could result in the reversion of these viruses to greater neurovirulence. When exposed to OPV, immunodeficient patients may become chronically infected, spreading potentially neurovirulent VDPVs for many months or years to close contacts and children who are no longer being vaccinated after termination of OPV vaccination in the near future.”

Risks of reintroduction of polio after eradication: the vaccine origin of an outbreak of type 3 poliomyelitis.
“Sabin live-attenuated strains, which have proved to be the most effective tools for poliovirus eradication, could also be the source of reintroduction of polio epidemics after global eradication of wild poliomyelitis is achieved. There are still considerable gaps in our knowledge about the persistence of vaccine-derived viruses in the population and the mechanisms involved in poliovirus transmissibility, both of which are essential factors in assessing the risks posed by such strains and in designing effective strategies for the cessation of polio immunisation. In this report, we have examined virological and epidemiological aspects of an epidemic of poliomyelitis in 1968 in Poland that was shown to be associated with the use of the USOL-D-bac live-attenuated vaccine strain. Possible causes of the origin and progress of the outbreak included the pattern of virus excretion from vaccinees, mutations identified in epidemic viruses and the unique vaccination policies in Poland during the years preceding the epidemic.”

Shedding of virulent poliovirus revertants during immunization with oral poliovirus vaccine after prior immunization with inactivated polio vaccine.
“Fecal shedding of virulent revertant polioviruses was examined in isolates from infants previously immunized with &gt; or = 1 dose of orally administered live attenuated polio vaccine (OPV) alone, enhanced-potency inactivated polio vaccine (EIPV) alone, or a combination of both. After administration of OPV alone, vaccine poliovirus serotypes were recovered in feces within 1 week and for as long as 31-60 days in 30%-80% of subjects after 1 or 2 doses and in 30%-50% after immunization with &gt; or = 3 doses. No revertant poliovirus shedding was observed after OPV challenge in subjects immunized previously with &gt; or = 3 doses of OPV. However, fecal shedding of revertant poliovirus after OPV challenge was observed in 50%-100% of subjects previously immunized with &gt; or = 3 doses of the EIPV. These findings suggest that prior immunization with EIPV does not prevent fecal shedding of revertant polioviruses after subsequent reexposure to OPV.”

Simian cytomegalovirus and contamination of oral poliovirus vaccines.
“In the 1950s the use of primary rhesus macaque kidney cultures to propagate poliovirus for vaccine production led to the contamination of vaccines with simian virus 40 (SV40). African green monkey kidney (AGMK) cultures free of SV40 were used as an alternative cell substrate for vaccine manufacture. In this study we evaluate oral poliovirus seeds, vaccine bulks and vaccines themselves for the presence of a common contaminant of AGMK cultures, simian cytomegalovirus (SCMV). Using sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques, nearly half of the samples analysed were found to be contaminated with SCMV sequences. However, vaccine bulks, positive by PCR for SCMV failed to show any evidence of infectious virus in these studies. One poliovirus vaccine and one seed, propagated on rhesus macaque kidney cultures were found to be positive for the rhesus monkey CMV by PCR.”

Some ethical issues arising from polio eradication programmes in India.
“The issue of risks and benefits arises in relation to the choice between two different vaccine types available for polio programmes: oral polio vaccine (OPV) and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). OPV is the vaccine currently used in the eradication campaign in India. We argue that given the current risks/benefits profile of this vaccine, there is an urgent need to review the programme and take remedial action to address existing problems (at least in India). The second issue we discuss is the fact that there is little effort to gain the informed consent of the parents of vaccinated children, as they are not currently told about the potential limitations of OPV or the possibility of vaccine-induced harm.”

Some oral poliovirus vaccines were contaminated with infectious SV40 after 1961.
“Some polio vaccines prepared from 1954 to 1961 were contaminated with infectious SV40. It has been assumed that all polio vaccines were SV40 free in the United States after 1961 and in other countries after 1962. Following a WHO requirement that was prompted by the detection of SV40 in some human tumors, we conducted a multilaboratory study to test for SV40 polio vaccines prepared after 1961. Vaccine samples from 13 countries and the WHO seed were initially tested by PCR. The possible presence of intact and/or infectious SV40 DNA in PCR-positive samples was tested by transfection and infection of permissive CV-1 cells. All results were verified by immunohistochemistry, cloning, and sequencing. All the vaccines were SV40 free, except for vaccines from a major eastern European manufacturer that contained infectious SV40. We determined that the procedure used by this manufacturer to inactivate SV40 in oral poliovirus vaccine seed stocks based on heat inactivation in the presence of MgCl2 did not completely inactivate SV40. These SV40-contaminated vaccines were produced from early 1960s to about 1978 and were used throughout the world. Our findings underscore the potential risks of using primary monkey cells for preparing poliovirus vaccines, because of the possible contamination with SV40 or other monkey viruses, and emphasize the importance of using well-characterized cell substrates that are free from adventitious agents. Moreover, our results indicate possible geographic differences in SV40 exposure and offer a possible explanation for the different percentage of SV40-positive tumors detected in some laboratories.”

“Poliovirus was isolated from six subjects who were defined as contact vaccine-associated cases. Characterization of isolates by both antigenic and molecular methods showed that, in all cases, the disease was associated with type 2 or 3 polioviruses of vaccine origin with retromutations known to be associated with loss of Sabin attenuated phenotype. Infection occurred despite the fact that all patients had records of previous immunization with oral polio vaccine (OPV), suggesting a failure of vaccination.”

[SV40 as a possible cofactor in the etiopathogenesis of mesothelioma and other human tumors].
“Simian virus 40 (SV40) has been introduced into the human population with contaminated polio vaccines between 1955 and 1963. Previous research conducted by southern blot hybridization and recent analysis by PCR have shown the presence of SW0 sequences in human brain tumors, mesotheliomas and osteosarcomas as well as in normal tissues such as blood and sperm fluids. SV40 RNA and T antigen were detected in the same tissues. All the samples were coinfected by BK Virus (BKV), suggesting that BKV may have a helper function for SV40 replication in human cells. The presence of SV40 in human tumors suggests that the virus may be a cofactor in the etiopathogenesis of human neoplasia. In addition, blood and semen may represent the vectors for transmission of SV40 by horizontal infection in the human population.”

Use of a novel real-time PCR assay to detect oral polio vaccine shedding and reversion in stool and sewage samples after a mexican national immunization day.
“During replication, oral polio vaccine (OPV) can revert to neurovirulence and cause paralytic poliomyelitis. In individual vaccinees, it can acquire specific revertant point mutations, leading to vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP). With longer replication, OPV can mutate into vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV), which causes poliomyelitis outbreaks similar to those caused by wild poliovirus. After wild poliovirus eradication, safely phasing out vaccination will likely require global use of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) until cessation of OPV circulation.”

Symmetrical lower motor neuron involvement of deltoid muscles with electromyographic confirmation was found. Upper motor neuron signs, with symmetrical hyperactive deep tendon reflexes developed in the lower extremities. Poliovirus Type-2 vaccine-like strain was cultured from one patient and both patients showed significant antibody titers rises to poliovirus. Attention is drawn to the possible clinical differences between vaccine associated poliomelitis and the usual features found in wild strain poliomyelitis. It is suggested that in selected cases, non-immunized contacts be given inactivated polio-vaccine when the vaccinees are immunized with the live oral-vaccine.”

Neurological and electrophysiological examinations suggested that his muscular wasting of the left lower limb was due to a lower motor neuron disorder, and magnetic resonance imaging revealed the responsible lesion in the left anterior horn at the thoracolumbar junction. His stool was found to include poliovirus type 3, mainly originating from Sabin 3 by neutrization antibody and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. This indicated that the AAP resulted from contact with his son.”

The epidemic followed small-scale trials with Sabin and USOL-D-bac type 3 vaccine strains carried out in seven countries including Poland. Factors that might have contributed to the genesis and development of the epidemic were the pattern of virus excretion from vaccinees, mutations found in viruses from the epidemic, and the particular vaccination policies in Poland during the previous years.”

ð [Vaccines, biotechnology and their connection with induced abortion].
“Diploid cells (WI-38, MRC-5) vaccines have their origin in induced abortions. Among these vaccines we fi nd the following: rubella, measles, mumps, rabies, polio, smallpox, hepatitis A, chickenpox, and herpes zoster. Nowadays, other abortion tainted vaccines cultivated on transformed cells (293, PER.C6) are in the pipeline: flu, Respiratory Syncytial and parainfluenza viruses, HIV, West Nile virus, Ebola, Marburg and Lassa, hepatitis B and C, foot and mouth disease, Japanese encephalitis, dengue, tuberculosis, anthrax, plague, tetanus and malaria. The same method is used for the production of monoclonal antibodies and other proteins, gene therapy and genomics. Technology enables us to develop the aforementioned products without resorting to induced abortion. Full disclosure of the cell origin in the labelling of vaccines and other products must be supported. There are vaccines from non-objectionable sources which should be made available to the public. When no alternative vaccines exist, ethical research must be promoted. Non-objectionable sources in the production of monoclonal antibodies, gene therapy and genomics must be encouraged. It is not be consistent to abstain from products originated in embryonic stem cells and at the same time approve of products obtained from induced abortions. It is of paramount importance to avoid that induced abortion technology seeps into every field of Medicine.”

Current Safety Concerns with Human Papillomavirus Vaccine: A Cluster Analysis of Reports in VigiBase® (2017)
“Cluster analysis reveals additional reports of AEs following HPV vaccination that are serious in nature and describe symptoms that overlap those reported in cases from the recent safety signals (POTS, CRPS, and CFS), but which do not report explicit diagnoses. While the causal association between HPV vaccination and these AEs remains uncertain, more extensive analyses of spontaneous reports can better identify the relevant case series for thorough signal evaluation.”

                                ð [Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis after tetanus vaccination of a pregnant woman in Senegal].
Although neurological complications have been described after tetanus vaccinations, they are rare. The authors report a case of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) in a 28-year-old pregnant woman at a gestational age of 10 weeks, admitted 15 days after a tetanus vaccination, with spastic tetraplegia and sphincter disturbances. Corticosteroid treatment led to partial recovery of the neurological deficit. Differential diagnosis of infectious and demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system is difficult in view of clinical and laboratory aspects of post-vaccination ADEM. Without any specific diagnostic markers, the clinical examination, magnetic resonance imaging and negative etiological findings were key to this diagnosis. Medical staff must bear in mind the possible complications of this vaccine.

ð Are toxic biometals destroying your childrenâs future?
“Cadmium, arsenic, lead, and mercury have been linked to autism, attention deficit disorder, mental retardation and death of children. Mercury in thimerosal found in many vaccines and flu shots contributes significantly to these problems. Decomposition of the thimerosal can produce more toxic compounds, either methylethylmercury or diethylmercury, in the body. These compounds have a toxicity level similar to dimethylmercury. Within the human body, a mitochondrial disorder may release the more toxic form of mercury internally. Young children and pregnant women must minimize internal exposure to the vaccines and flu shots containing mercury.”

Fetal damage after accidental polio vaccination of an immune mother.
“Irreparable damage to the anterior horn cells of the cervical and thoracic cord was found in a 20-week-old fetus whose mother was immune to poliomyelitis before conceiving but who was inadvertently given oral polio vaccine at 18 weeks gestation. Polio neutralizing antibody titres in sera, taken before and after pregnancy, were identical and were at levels normally regarded as providing protection. Unsuccessful attempts were made to isolate poliovirus from extracts of fetal brain, lung, liver and placenta. Fluorescent antibody tests were performed on various levels of the central nervous system and on the left and right extensor forearm muscles. Specific positive fluorescence to poliovirus 2 and 3 antigens was detected at dorsal spinal cord level only. One positive result was seen with Coxsackie A9 antiserum and fresh guinea-pig complement in the inflammatory cells in the right extensor forearm muscles.This experience, as yet unexplained, underlines the importance of ensuring that women are not pregnant prior to oral polio vaccination.”

                                Adverse events following vaccination in premature infants.
“Apparent adverse events were noted in 17 of 45 (37.8%) babies: 9 (20%) had major events, i.e. apnoea, bradycardia or desaturations, and 8 (17.8%) had minor events, i.e. increased oxygen requirements, temperature instability, poor handling and feed intolerance. Babies with major events were significantly younger (p &lt; 0.05), had a lower postmenstrual age (p &lt; 0.05) and weighed less (p &lt; 0.05) at the time of vaccination compared with babies without major events.&quot; &quot;CONCLUSION: Vaccine-related cardiorespiratory events are relatively common in preterm babies. Problems were much more common if vaccine is administered at or before 70 d. These babies should therefore be monitored postvaccination.&quot;

🛑 [Cardiorespiratory events after first immunization in premature infants: a prospective cohort study].
“OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether all preterm infants born before 33 weeks of gestation need cardiorespiratory monitoring due to the risk of cardiorespiratory disturbances following their first vaccination at 2 months of age.”
“In this cohort of 41 premature infants whose mean gestational age was 30.8 weeks (SD: 1.9), 10 of these had a mild decrease in oxygen saturation or bradycardia; three developed a moderate cardiorespiratory event requiring tactile stimulation.”
“It is recommended that still-hospitalized premature infants receive their first immunizations under cardiorespiratory monitoring, as events were observed during a period of 0-24 hours thereafter.”

Incidence of apnoea and bradycardia in preterm infants following triple antigen immunization.
“Ninety-seven preterm infants were immunized with diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) prior to discharge from hospital. The mean gestational age at birth was 28.1 weeks (range 24-34) and the mean age at immunization was 80.6 days (range 44-257). Nineteen (20%) infants developed apnoea or bradycardia within 24 h of immunization. The infants who developed apnoea and/or bradycardia had a younger gestational age at birth than those who did not (P = 0.03), were artificially ventilated for longer (P = 0.01) and were more likely to have a diagnosis of chronic lung disease (P = 0.006). In the majority of infants these events were not clinically significant. Two infants who developed concurrent upper respiratory tract infections required additional oxygen and one of them was treated with oral theophylline. In general, it is safe practice to immunize preterm infants with DTP unless otherwise contraindicated. However, it is recommended that cardiorespiratory function is monitored after immunization in very preterm infants who had prolonged ventilatory support and/or chronic lung disease.”

“Immunization was performed on 31 very preterm infants [28 weeks’ gestation (26.9-29), birth weight: 965 g (795-1,105)], and was associated with an increased incidence (p &lt; 0.01) of events lasting more than 10 s: bradycardia &lt;80 bpm [2.2 (1.1-7) vs. 1.8 (1-4)/12 h], desaturation [17.6 (9.4-36.4) vs. 13.9 (7.7-33.8)/12 h] and associated bradycardia-desaturation [IB+D, 4.1 (1.4-7.3) vs. 2.4 (1-4.6)/12 h], with mild changes in HRV and no change in RRV.&quot; 
&quot;The increase in CR events after the first immunization in very preterm infants was associated with: (1) sympathetic predominance in heart rate control (high LF/HF ratio), (2) abnormal oversimplification of HRV (low entropy) and (3) persistent respiratory rhythm control immaturity (high IB+D before vaccine).&quot;

Recurrence of cardiorespiratory events following repeat DTaP-based combined immunization in very low birth weight premature infants.
“We evaluated the tolerance to immunization of 64 very low birth weight preterm infants. Thirty-three of the infants experienced a cardiorespiratory event after the first vaccination, and 6 of these 33 (18%) had a recurrence after the second vaccination, including 2 infants previously discharged to home. A cardiorespiratory event associated with the first vaccination was the sole risk factor for recurrence identified.”

Vaccination of preterm infants by polyvalent vaccines: immunogenicity and safety- review of literature.
“In order to reduce the risk of adverse events after the administration of a polyvalent vaccine, it is essential to carefully consider the cardiorespiratory status of preterm infants during preimmunization examination, as well as their history of any cardiorespiratory dysfunctions. In such cases administering the first dose of the vaccine in a hospital setting is strongly advised.”

Simian cytomegalovirus-related stealth virus isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of a patient with bipolar psychosis and acute encephalopathy.
“A cytopathic ‘stealthâ virus was cultured from the cerebrospinal fluid of a patient with a bipolar psychotic disorder who developed a severe encephalopathy leading to a vegetative state. DNA sequencing of a polymerase chain reaction-amplified product from infected cultures has identified the virus as an African green monkey simian cytomegalovirus (SCMV)-related stealth virus. The virus is similar to the SCMV-related stealth virus isolated from a patient with chronic fatigue syndrome. The findings support the concepts that stealth viruses can account for a spectrum of dysfunctional brain diseases and that some of these viruses may have arisen from live polio viral vaccines.”

                                ð Adverse effect versus quality control of the Fuenzalida-Palacios antirabies vaccine.
“We evaluated the components of the Fuenzalida-Palacios antirabies vaccine, which is till used in most developing countries in human immunization for treatment and prophylaxis. This vaccine is prepared from newborn mouse brains at 1% concentration. Even though the vaccine is considered to have a low myelin content, it is not fully free of myelin or of other undesirable components that might trigger adverse effects after vaccination. The most severe effect is a post-vaccination neuroparalytic accident associated with Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome. In the present study we demonstrate how the vaccines produced and distributed by different laboratories show different component patterns with different degrees of impurity and with varying protein concentrations, indicating that production processes can vary from one laboratory to another. These differences, which could be resolved using a better quality control process, may affect and impair immunization, with consequent risks and adverse effects after vaccination. We used crossed immunoelectrophoresis to evaluate and demonstrate the possibility of quality control in vaccine production, reducing the risk factors possibly involved in these immunizing products.”

ANTIRABIES ANTIBODY RESPONSE IN MAN TO VACCINE MADE FROM INFECTED SUCKLING-MOUSE BRAINS.
“Antirabies vaccines produced from infected brains of adult mammals have always had the potentiality of causing post-vaccinal paralysis or allergic encephalitis in man. Attempts in recent years either to remove the paralytic factor from brain-tissue vaccines or to use as the virus source infected tissue other than nervous tissue (e.g., chick embryos) have usually resulted in a substantial reduction of the specific antirabies potency.”

Guillain-Barre syndrome occurring after rabies vaccination.
“A variety of events are associated with the onset of Guillain-Barre syndrome, including vaccinations and vaccines. These are the swine influenza vaccine, oral poliovirus vaccine and rabies vaccine. Rabies is a uniformly fatal disease. It is preventable if World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for post exposure treatment (PET) are followed. These include local treatment of wound, passive immunization with rabies immunoglobulins and administration of a efficacious vaccine. Cell culture vaccines are highly immunogenic with fewer side effects, but are costly. For that reason neurotissue vaccines are still widely used in Pakistan, although they are less immunogenic with higher incidence of neuroparalytic complications. We report a case of Guillain-Barre syndrome secondary to sheep brain anti-rabies vaccine in a young boy, who presented with lower limb weakness with total recovery after treatment.”

Sudden hearing loss after rabies vaccination.
“BACKGROUND: Sudden hearing loss developing after immunisation is a very rare situation. Rabies is a viral disease characterised by encephalitis and death. Treatment involves active and passive immunisation. Neurologic complications including Guillain-Barre syndrome or facial paralysis are reported in the literature as a side effect after rabies immunisation.
CASE REPORT: Sudden hearing loss was detected in an 11 year-old male patient who had taken the medication for rabies immunisation.
CONCLUSION: This study presents a case report of sudden hearing loss developing after rabies immunisation - no other aetiological factors were detected and clinical management is discussed in light of the literature.”

Sudden onset unilateral sensorineural hearing loss after rabies vaccination.
“A 33-year-old man developed profound sudden onset right-sided hearing loss with tinnitus and vertigo, within 24 h of pretravel rabies vaccination. There was no history of upper respiratory tract infection, systemic illness, ototoxic medication or trauma, and normal otoscopic examination. Pure tone audiograms (PTA) demonstrated right-sided sensorineural hearing loss (thresholds 90-100 dB) and normal left-sided hearing. MRI internal acoustic meatus, viral serology (hepatitis B, C, HIV and cytomegalovirus) and syphilis screen were normal. Positive Epstein-Barr virus IgG, viral capsid IgG and anticochlear antibodies (anti-HSP-70) were noted. Initial treatment involved a course of high-dose oral prednisolone and acyclovir. Repeat PTAs after 12 days of treatment showed a small improvement in hearing thresholds. Salvage intratympanic steroid injections were attempted but failed to improve hearing further. Sudden onset sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) is an uncommon but frightening experience for patients. This is the first report of SSNHL following rabies immunisation in an adult.”

The same method is used for the production of monoclonal antibodies and other proteins, gene therapy and genomics. Technology enables us to develop the aforementioned products without resorting to induced abortion. Full disclosure of the cell origin in the labelling of vaccines and other products must be supported. There are vaccines from non-objectionable sources which should be made available to the public. When no alternative vaccines exist, ethical research must be promoted. Non-objectionable sources in the production of monoclonal antibodies, gene therapy and genomics must be encouraged. It is not be consistent to abstain from products originated in embryonic stem cells and at the same time approve of products obtained from induced abortions. It is of paramount importance to avoid that induced abortion technology seeps into every field of Medicine.”

Abortive and subclinical poliomyelitis in a family during the 1992 epidemic in The Netherlands.
“We describe a case of abortive poliomyelitis due to poliovirus type 3 (PV3) in an unvaccinated woman and a subclinical poliovirus infection in her family during an epidemic in the Netherlands. The woman excreted the epidemic strain (PV3) for 7 weeks. Her two children received oral attenuated poliovirus vaccine and were subsequently found to excrete PV1 and PV2 vaccine strains in addition to the epidemic PV3 strain. Her husband, who had neutralizing antibodies to all three poliovirus types because of previous vaccination, initially excreted no virus; subsequently, however, the vaccine strain PV1 and the epidemic strain PV3 could be cultured from his feces.”

Accidental vaccinia of the vulva.
“Vaccinia of the vulva in a 32-year-old married woman is described. The vaccination was apparently due to a heteroinoculation from her husband during sexual contact. Clinically it presented as an indurated ulcer with a few isolated umbilicated vesicles and was associated with an acute biological false-positive serological reactions.”

Eczema vaccinatum resulting from the transmission of vaccinia virus from a smallpox vaccinee: an investigation of potential fomites in the home environment.
“On March 3, 2007, a 2-year-old boy was hospitalized with eczema vaccinatum. His two siblings, one with eczema, were subsequently removed from the home. Swabs of household items obtained on March 13th were analyzed for orthopoxvirus DNA signatures with real-time PCR. Virus culture was attempted on positive specimens. Eight of 25 household samples were positive by PCR for orthopoxvirus; of these, three yielded viable vaccinia virus in culture. Both siblings were found to have serologic evidence of orthopoxvirus exposure.”

🛑 Finding the ‘who’ in whooping cough: vaccinated siblings are important pertussis sources in infants 6 months of age and under.
“At its peak, siblings were the most important sources of pertussis in infants 6 months and younger, particularly fully vaccinated children aged 2 and 3 years. Waning immunity before the booster at 4 years may leave this age group susceptible to infection.”

How Contagious Is Vaccinia?
“A report on vaccine-related deaths in the United States during the 1960s found that 12 of the 68 deaths occurred in unvaccinated persons exposed to recently vaccinated family members or friends, a finding that demonstrates the potential gravity of the problem.” 
“Numerous reports have described the spread of vaccinia virus within families. The majority are in- stances of single transmission, usually from a re- cently vaccinated child to an unvaccinated younger sibling.22-25 However, two or more secondary cas- es have been reported in at least eight reports of family outbreaks published from 1931 to 198126-33 (Table 2). Many of the reports describe severe, some- times fatal eczema vaccinatum in the first family member with secondary disease and substantially milder local inoculation disease in the rest of the family.”

🛑 Imported Vaccine-Associated Paralytic Poliomyelitis — United States, 2005
“This report describes the first known occurrence of imported VAPP in an unvaccinated U.S. adult who traveled abroad, where she likely was exposed through contact with an infant recently vaccinated with OPV.”
“Upon admission to a hospital in Phoenix, the patient had bilateral areflexic lower extremity weakness and respiratory failure requiring intubation.” 
“The host family’s son and daughter-in-law lived next door with two children, aged 2 months and 3 years, who visited the host family frequently. The infant received his first dose of OPV on January 19, 2005, 4 days after the woman arrived to live with the host family.”

Isolation of recombinant type 2 vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) from a Nigerian child.
“A type 2 vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV), differing from Sabin 2 at 2.5% (22/903) of VP1 nucleotide (nt) positions, was isolated from an incompletely immunized 21-month-old Nigerian child who developed acute flaccid paralysis in 2002.” 
“The date of the initiating OPV dose, calculated from the number of synonymous substitutions in the capsid region, was estimated to be approximately 16 to 18 months before onset of paralysis, a finding inconsistent with the most recent mass OPV campaign (conducted 12 days before onset of paralysis) as being the source of infection.”

Outbreak of poliomyelitis in Hispaniola associated with circulating type 1 vaccine-derived poliovirus.
“An outbreak of paralytic poliomyelitis occurred in the Dominican Republic (13 confirmed cases) and Haiti (8 confirmed cases, including 2 fatal cases) during 2000-2001. All but one of the patients were either unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated children, and cases occurred in communities with very low (7 to 40%) rates of coverage with oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV). The outbreak was associated with the circulation of a derivative of the type 1 OPV strain, probably originating from a single OPV dose given in 1998-1999. The vaccine-derived poliovirus associated with the outbreak had biological properties indistinguishable from those of wild poliovirus.”

Poliomyelitis Associated With Type 2 Virus
Paralytic Disease in the Father of a Recently Immunized Child
“Paralytic poliomyelitis was diagnosed clinically in a 29-year-old man three weeks after his 2-year-old son received trivalent live oral poliovirus vaccine. Type 2 poliovirus with “vaccine-like” characteristics was isolated from the patient’s stool, and the serum showed a significant rise in neutralizing antibody against type 2 virus. There was no rise in complement fixation antibody titers. The patients illness was likely due to type 2 poliovirus contracted from his son. Physicians should inquire about the immunization status of parents before administering vaccine to children.”

Poliovirus Infections in Four Unvaccinated Children — Minnesota, August-October 2005
“On September 29, 2005, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) identified poliovirus type 1 in an unvaccinated, immunocompromised infant girl aged 7 months (the index patient) in an Amish community whose members predominantly were unvaccinated for polio. The patient has no paralysis; the source of the patient’s infection is unknown. Subsequently, poliovirus infections in three other children within the index patient’s community have been documented.” 
“Partial sequencing of the virus capsid protein coding region (VP1) of the poliovirus genome at the MDH laboratory identified it as a vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV). VDPVs are poliovirus strains derived from one of the three Sabin poliovirus strains in oral polio vaccine (OPV) that have &gt;1% difference in nucleotide sequence from the prototype vaccine virus.”

Risk of Contact Vaccinia From Immunization Sites
“To the Editor: Dr Garde and and colleagues1stated that “The mechanism of transfer from the vaccinee to the spouse is uncertain.” They did not report, however, whether they asked about mouth-to-nipple contact from the vaccinee to the spouse. Oral shedding of virus could transmit the virus via direct mucosal contact.”

Secondary and tertiary transmission of vaccinia virus after sexual contact with a smallpox vaccinee–San Diego, California, 2012.
“On June 24, 2012, CDC notified Public Health Services, County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency, of a suspected case of vaccinia virus infection transmitted by sexual contact. The case had been reported to CDC by an infectious disease specialist who had requested vaccinia immune globulin intravenous (VIGIV) (Cangene Corporation, Berwyn, Pennsylvania) for a patient with lesions suspicious for vaccinia. The patient reported two recent sexual contacts: one with a partner who recently had been vaccinated against smallpox and a later encounter with an unvaccinated partner. Infections resulting from secondary transmission of vaccinia virus from the smallpox vaccinee to the patient and subsequent tertiary transmission of the virus from the patient to the unvaccinated partner were confirmed by the County of San Diego Public Health Laboratory. The smallpox vaccine had been administered under the U.S. Department of Defense smallpox vaccination program. The vaccinee did not experience vaccine-associated complications; however, the secondary and tertiary patients were hospitalized and treated with VIGIV. No further transmission was known to have occurred. This report describes the epidemiology and clinical course of the secondary and tertiary cases and efforts to prevent further transmission to contacts.”

Secondary transmission of varicella vaccine virus in a chronic care facility for children.
“A 16-year-old varicella-seronegative resident at a chronic care facility received varicella vaccine; 15 days later he developed severe varicella. Subsequently, a 13-year-old resident and a 39-year-old health care worker developed mild varicella. We demonstrate that vaccine-strain virus was transmitted to both persons, and that transmission included at least 2 variant vaccine strains.”

Surveillance of suspected poliomyelitis in Albania, 1980-1995: suggestion of increased risk of vaccine associated poliomyelitis.
“Poliovirus was isolated from six subjects who were defined as contact vaccine-associated cases. Characterization of isolates by both antigenic and molecular methods showed that, in all cases, the disease was associated with type 2 or 3 polioviruses of vaccine origin with retromutations known to be associated with loss of Sabin attenuated phenotype. Infection occurred despite the fact that all patients had records of previous immunization with oral polio vaccine (OPV), suggesting a failure of vaccination.”

Transmission of vaccinia virus, possibly through sexual contact, to a woman at high risk for adverse complications.
“Severe adverse events, including eczema vaccinatum (EV), can result after smallpox vaccination. Persons at risk for EV include those with underlying dermatologic conditions, such as atopic dermatitis. We investigated a case of vaccinia infection, possibly acquired during sexual contact with a recently vaccinated military service member, in a female Maryland resident with atopic dermatitis. The U.S. Department of Defense’s Vaccine Healthcare Centers Network (VHCN) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) worked in conjunction with the patient’s physician and the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH) to confirm the diagnosis, ensure treatment, and prevent further transmission. Specimens collected from the patient were tested at the DHMH laboratories and were positive by real-time polymerase chain reaction for nonvariola orthopoxvirus. Testing at the CDC verified the presence of vaccinia-specific DNA signatures. Continuing spread of the patient’s lesions led to the administration of vaccinia immune globulin and strict infection control measures to prevent tertiary transmission to vulnerable family members, also with atopic dermatitis. VHCN contacted the service member to reinforce vaccination site care and hygiene. This case underscores the importance of prevaccination education for those receiving the smallpox vaccine to protect contacts at risk for developing severe adverse reactions.”

Vaccine-associated contact paralytic poliomyelitis with atypical neurological presentation.
“Paralytic poliomyelitis presenting with quadriparesis, transient encephalitis and bulbar symptoms in 2 patients in close contact with recently vaccinated children with trivalent live oral polio vaccine is described. Symmetrical lower motor neuron involvement of deltoid muscles with electromyographic confirmation was found. Upper motor neuron signs, with symmetrical hyperactive deep tendon reflexes developed in the lower extremities. Poliovirus Type-2 vaccine-like strain was cultured from one patient and both patients showed significant antibody titers rises to poliovirus. Attention is drawn to the possible clinical differences between vaccine associated poliomelitis and the usual features found in wild strain poliomyelitis. It is suggested that in selected cases, non-immunized contacts be given inactivated polio-vaccine when the vaccinees are immunized with the live oral-vaccine.”

🛑 Vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis: a case report of domiciliary transmission.
“We herein present the case of an unvaccinated child, with a clinical picture of an acute anterior poliomyelitis associated with the live strain vaccine, whose brother received the Sabin vaccine 20 days before the onset of the symptoms. Vaccine strain of the type 3 poliovirus was isolated in fecal culture and a presented mutation in nucleotide 472 (C-&gt;U) in the 5′ non-coding region, which is strongly related to the higher strain virulence.”

Vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis caused by contact infection.
“We encountered an adult patient with acute anterior poliomyelitis (AAP), whose monoparesis developed 28 days after his son’s immunization with oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV). Neurological and electrophysiological examinations suggested that his muscular wasting of the left lower limb was due to a lower motor neuron disorder, and magnetic resonance imaging revealed the responsible lesion in the left anterior horn at the thoracolumbar junction. His stool was found to include poliovirus type 3, mainly originating from Sabin 3 by neutrization antibody and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. This indicated that the AAP resulted from contact with his son.”

Vaccinia virus infection after sexual contact with a military smallpox vaccinee -Washington, 2010.
“On March 1, 2010, the Washington State Department of Health (WADOH) notified Public Health – Seattle &amp; King County (PHSKC) of a suspected case of contact transmission of vaccinia virus from sexual contact with a member of the military who had been vaccinated against smallpox. Vaccinia virus infection after sexual contact has been reported previously (1-4). Despite the patient’s exposure history and clinical presentation, the diagnosis initially was not considered by the patient’s physician, who ordered laboratory testing for several common sexually transmitted infections. The patient was seen by a second physician and referred to an infectious disease specialist, who obtained a swab sample of a genital lesion for laboratory testing for vaccinia virus. Vaccinia virus was confirmed by the Washington State Public Health Laboratory (WAPHL) and the CDC Poxvirus Laboratory. The patient resided in a household with an immunosuppressed renal transplant recipient. Appropriate contact precautions were recommended to the patient. No additional cases of contact transmission were reported. This report describes the patient’s clinical course and the associated epidemiologic investigation. Health-care providers caring for U.S. military personnel or their contacts should consider vaccinia virus infection in the differential diagnosis of clinically compatible genital lesions. Contact precautions should be emphasized to all persons who are vaccinated, as well as their contacts with unexplained lesions that might represent vaccinia infection from contact transmission.”

Vulvar vaccinia infection after sexual contact with a military smallpox vaccinee–Alaska, 2006.
“On October 10, 2006, an otherwise healthy woman visited a public health clinic in Alaska after vaginal tears that she had first experienced 10 days before became increasingly painful. The patient reported having a new male sex partner during September 22-October 1, 2006. A viral swab specimen from a labial lesion of the woman was submitted to the Alaska State Virology Laboratory (ASVL) for viral culture. The viral isolate could not be identified initially and subsequently was sent to CDC on January 9, 2007, where the isolate was identified as a vaccine-strain vaccinia virus. After vaccinia was identified, investigators interviewed the woman more closely and learned that her new sex partner was a male U.S. military service member stationed at a local military base. Further investigation determined that the service member had been vaccinated for smallpox 3 days before beginning his relationship with the woman. This report describes the clinical evaluation of the woman and laboratory testing performed to identify the isolate. Health-care providers should be aware of the possibility of vaccinia infection in persons with clinically compatible genital lesions who have had recent contact with smallpox vaccinees.”

Vulvar vaccinia infection after sexual contact with a smallpox vaccinee.
“The United States ceased generalized smallpox vaccination in 1972 but reinstated it in 2002 for military personnel and selected healthcare workers (first responders who may be investigating possible cases of smallpox or caring for patients in selected hospitals) after the 2001 bioterrorism attacks. Since reinstitution of the vaccine, reports of transmission of vaccinia virus through contact with military smallpox vaccinees have been published, including four cases of female genital infection. We report a subsequent case of vulvar vaccinia infection acquired during sexual contact with a military vaccinee.”

Widespread eczema vaccinatum acquired by contacts. A report of an autopsy case
“A 4-month-old male infant predisposed to allergic dermatitis acquired wide-spread eczema vaccinatum by contacts with a recently vaccinated sibling. He died of acute purulent peritonitis following a perforation of multiple duodenal ulcers. Fluorescence immunocytochemical and electron microscopic studies on the skin lesions revealed the presence of viral antigens and numerous virus particles compatible morphologically with those of the mature form from the same batch of smallpox vaccine given to the sibling. A large number of virus particles in the developmental form were also predominantly scattered in the cytoplasm of cells at the stratum malpighii of the epidermis as well as in neutrophils and macrophages in the skin lesions. The virus isolation from the skin lesions was done by using the HeLa cells and the human embryonic lung fibroblasts. No abnormal laboratory data were noted in immunoglobulins. On the basis of atrophy of the thymus and other lymphatic tissues and an appearance of large pyroninophilic cells in association with blastoid transformation, the authors discussed a possible participation of the disturbance of cellular immunity secondary to the virus infection in the development of the disease.”

Adverse events following vaccination in premature infants.
“Apparent adverse events were noted in 17 of 45 (37.8%) babies: 9 (20%) had major events, i.e. apnoea, bradycardia or desaturations, and 8 (17.8%) had minor events, i.e. increased oxygen requirements, temperature instability, poor handling and feed intolerance. Babies with major events were significantly younger (p &lt; 0.05), had a lower postmenstrual age (p &lt; 0.05) and weighed less (p &lt; 0.05) at the time of vaccination compared with babies without major events.&quot; 
&quot;CONCLUSION: Vaccine-related cardiorespiratory events are relatively common in preterm babies. Problems were much more common if vaccine is administered at or before 70 d. These babies should therefore be monitored postvaccination.&quot;

ð Beta-tryptase and quantitative mast-cell increase in a sudden infant death following hexavalent immunization.
“A fatal case of a 3-month-old female infant, who died within 24 h of vaccination with hexavalent vaccine is presented. Clinical data, post-mortem findings (acute pulmonary oedema, acute pulmonary emphysema), quali-quantitative data collected from immunohistochemical staining (degranulating mast cells) and laboratory analysis with a high level of beta-tryptase in serum, 43.3 microg/l, allows us to conclude that acute respiratory failure likely due to post hexavalent immunization-related shock was the cause of death.”

“OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether all preterm infants born before 33 weeks of gestation need cardiorespiratory monitoring due to the risk of cardiorespiratory disturbances following their first vaccination at 2 months of age.”
“In this cohort of 41 premature infants whose mean gestational age was 30.8 weeks (SD: 1.9), 10 of these had a mild decrease in oxygen saturation or bradycardia; three developed a moderate cardiorespiratory event requiring tactile stimulation.”
“It is recommended that still-hospitalized premature infants receive their first immunizations under cardiorespiratory monitoring, as events were observed during a period of 0-24 hours thereafter.”

ð [Complications of pertussis immunization (author transl)].
“16 cases of neurological disease and/or death shortly after pertussis immunization are reported. Eight patients had convulsions, six with ensuing permanent defects. Severe polymyositis was observed in one case. Five infants died 12 h to 4 days after vaccination: two after acute encephalopathy and three in the form of a sudden unexpected death (SID). In two fatal cases the morphological changes in the brain corresponded to those of pertussis encephalopathy: neuronal degeneration in various parts of the cortex, especially in the region of the ammons horn, and in the cerebellum. There were no signs of inflammation. Three cases underwent forensic autopsy and death was attributed to bronchopulmonary infection. Complete neuropathological work-up was only done in one case, in which the brain was normal. The critique of episodical reports and the demand for prospective studies is appreciated. Knowledge of all possible forms of complications, however, is indispensable for future investigations. Polymyositis and SID have so far not been listed as abnormal reactions to immunization. The majority of our cases became known accidentally from hospital sheets or from discussions with collegues. For a detection of all possible cases a greater awareness of doctors for the problem of pertussis immunization appears necessary. Only another 23 cases have been reported to the health authorities of the state of Lower Saxony during the last 6 to 7 years. Of those, nine were either harmless reactions or diseases probably unrelated to vaccination. Two were cases of SID, 12 and 72 h after vaccination. It is concluded that only a minor proportion of possible complications is presently reported to the health authorities.”

Delayed life-threatening reaction to anthrax vaccine.
“CASE REPORT: We report a delayed and potentially serious life-threatening adverse reaction to anthrax vaccine. A previously healthy 34-year-old male was transported to the emergency department with dyspnea, diaphoresis, pallor, and urticarial wheals on his face, arms, and torso after the administration of the third dose of anthrax vaccine. All symptoms resolved after pharmacological intervention and the patient was discharged. Pharmaco-epidemiological data indicate that 30% of anthrax vaccine recipients experience mild local reactions. With large numbers of military personnel being vaccinated, emergency physicians may encounter more vaccine-related adverse reactions.”

Fatal adult respiratory distress syndrome in a scalded child after immunization with attenuated virus (measles, mumps and rubella).
“A fatal adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurred in a 15-month-old child who had suffered minor scalding during the febrile response to combined attenuated virus immunization (measles, mumps and rubella [MMR]). Despite vigorous efforts the child died 26 days after the accident. It is suggested that the scalding suppressed the normal immune response to the viremia and that the latter (i.e. most likely the measles viremia) caused the lung damage which, in turn, led to the ARDS.”

ð Imported Vaccine-Associated Paralytic Poliomyelitis — United States, 2005
“This report describes the first known occurrence of imported VAPP in an unvaccinated U.S. adult who traveled abroad, where she likely was exposed through contact with an infant recently vaccinated with OPV.”
“Upon admission to a hospital in Phoenix, the patient had bilateral areflexic lower extremity weakness and respiratory failure requiring intubation.”
“The host familyâs son and daughter-in-law lived next door with two children, aged 2 months and 3 years, who visited the host family frequently. The infant received his first dose of OPV on January 19, 2005, 4 days after the woman arrived to live with the host family.”

Incidence of apnoea and bradycardia in preterm infants following triple antigen immunization.
“Ninety-seven preterm infants were immunized with diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) prior to discharge from hospital. The mean gestational age at birth was 28.1 weeks (range 24-34) and the mean age at immunization was 80.6 days (range 44-257). Nineteen (20%) infants developed apnoea or bradycardia within 24 h of immunization. The infants who developed apnoea and/or bradycardia had a younger gestational age at birth than those who did not (P = 0.03), were artificially ventilated for longer (P = 0.01) and were more likely to have a diagnosis of chronic lung disease (P = 0.006). In the majority of infants these events were not clinically significant. Two infants who developed concurrent upper respiratory tract infections required additional oxygen and one of them was treated with oral theophylline. In general, it is safe practice to immunize preterm infants with DTP unless otherwise contraindicated. However, it is recommended that cardiorespiratory function is monitored after immunization in very preterm infants who had prolonged ventilatory support and/or chronic lung disease.”

Mycobacterium bovis lymphadenitis complicating BCG immunization in an infant with symptomatic HIV-1 infection.
“A 3-month-old infant with HIV-1 infection who recently immigrated from Ethiopia developed regional lymphadenitis and systemic symptoms subsequent to BCG immunization. She was suffering from axillary lymphadenitis ipsilateral to the BCG vaccination site, failure to thrive, unresolving fever and hepatosplenomegaly. Acid-fast bacilli were seen on staining and Mycobacterium bovis was isolated from the regional lymph node. The infant responded promptly to triple antituberculous therapy but died 2 months later from overwhelming pneumonia and respiratory failure. This case emphasizes the iatrogenic hazards of BCG immunization in HIV-1 infected infants. With the increasing prevalence of pediatric HIV-1 infection, indiscriminate BCG immunization programs should be reconsidered. While infants with asymptomatic HIV-1 infection at risk for tuberculosis should be immunized, BCG immunization should be withheld in those with symptomatic disease.”

Possible predictors of cardiorespiratory events after immunization in preterm neonates.
“Immunization was performed on 31 very preterm infants [28 weeksâ gestation (26.9-29), birth weight: 965 g (795-1,105)], and was associated with an increased incidence (p &lt; 0.01) of events lasting more than 10 s: bradycardia &lt;80 bpm [2.2 (1.1-7) vs. 1.8 (1-4)/12 h], desaturation [17.6 (9.4-36.4) vs. 13.9 (7.7-33.8)/12 h] and associated bradycardia-desaturation [IB+D, 4.1 (1.4-7.3) vs. 2.4 (1-4.6)/12 h], with mild changes in HRV and no change in RRV.&quot; 
&quot;The increase in CR events after the first immunization in very preterm infants was associated with: (1) sympathetic predominance in heart rate control (high LF/HF ratio), (2) abnormal oversimplification of HRV (low entropy) and (3) persistent respiratory rhythm control immaturity (high IB+D before vaccine).&quot;

Potential risk of repeated nasal vaccination that induces allergic reaction with mucosal IgE and airway eosinophilic infiltration in cynomolgus macaques infected with H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus.
“On the other hand, eosinophil clusters were observed in the lungs of vaccinated macaques. Although Vac-3-specific IgE antibody and IL-13 levels were decreased after infection compared to those before infection and no anaphylaxis in vaccinated macaques was detected after challenge infection, our results suggest that we have to pay attention to potential allergic responses at repeated nasal vaccination, especially in people who have an airway allergy.”

Vaccine-related adverse events in Cuban children, 1999-2008.
“The DTwP vaccine exhibited the highest rate of adverse events. Common minor events were: fever (17,538), reactions at injection site (4470) and systemic side effects (2422). Rare events (by WHO definition) reported were: persistent crying (2666), hypotonic-hyporesponsive episodes (3), encephalopathy (2) and febrile seizures (112). Severe events included: anaphylaxis (2), respiratory distress (1), multiple organ failure (1), sudden death (1), vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (2), toxic shock syndrome (3), and sepsis (1). The 10 deaths and 3 cases of disability were investigated by an expert commission, which concluded that 8 of the 13 severe events were vaccination-related.”

Neurodevelopmental disorders, maternal Rh-negativity, and Rho(D) immune globulins: a multi-center assessment.
“RESULTS: There were significant and comparable increases in maternal Rh-negativity among children with NDs (Clinic: A=24.2%), autism spectrum disorders (Clinic: A=28.3%, B=25.3%), and attention-deficit-disorder/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder (Clinic: A=26.3%) observed at both clinics in comparison to both control groups (Clinic: A=12.1%, B=13.9%) employed. Children with NDs born post-2001 had a maternal Rh-negativity frequency (13.6%) similar to controls.
CONCLUSION: This study associates TCR exposure with some NDs in children.”

Gastrointestinal immunopathology and food allergy.
“In contrast to the beneficial expressions of gastrointestinal-associated lymphoid tissue, which are seen with relevance to newer methods of delivery of vaccines directly applied to the gastrointestinal mucosal surfaces (eg, oral poliovirus, rotavirus, Salmonella typhi vaccines), the adverse consequences of a mucosal immune response gone astray are evidenced in many diseases such as FA. A classification of clinical disorders associated with FA based on classic mechanisms of immunologic injury is presented, which includes the following: (1) IgE-mediated, (2) non-IgE-mediated, and (3) mixed IgE- and non-IgE-mediated disorders. Our study of immunologic disturbance in patients with non-IgE FA revealed a pattern of increased CD4+ and decreased TH1 cell counts in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in contrast to patients with celiac disease, where a pattern of increased CD8+ and TH1 cell counts in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and increased CD8+ cell counts was seen.”

Porcine circovirus (PCV) removal by Q sepharose fast flow chromatography. 
“The recently discovered contamination of oral rotavirus vaccines led to exposure of millions of infants to porcine circovirus (PCV). PCV was not detected by conventional virus screening tests. Regulatory agencies expect exclusion of adventitious viruses from biological products. Therefore, methods for inactivation/removal of viruses have to be implemented as an additional safety barrier whenever feasible. However, inactivation or removal of PCV is difficult. PCV is highly resistant to widely used physicochemical inactivation procedures. Circoviruses such as PCV are the smallest viruses known and are not expected to be effectively removed by currently-used virus filters due to the small size of the circovirus particles. Anion exchange chromatography such as Q Sepharose(®) Fast Flow (QSFF) has been shown to effectively remove a range of viruses including parvoviruses. In this study, we investigated PCV1 removal by virus filtration and by QSFF chromatography. As expected, PCV1 could not be effectively removed by virus filtration. However, PCV1 could be effectively removed by QSFF as used during the purification of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and a log10 reduction value (LRV) of 4.12 was obtained.

Post-rotavirus vaccine intussusception in identical twins: A case report.
“Two infants aged 3 months, vaccinated against rotavirus. After about a week, one of the 2 identical infants presented inconsolable crying, vomiting, loose stools mixed with blood, and was diagnosed with bowel obstruction with intussusception. He was operated in urgency. After a few hours, his brother presented vomiting, and was admitted to our Hospital for suspected intussusception.”

Risk of intussusception following rotavirus vaccination: An evidence based meta-analysis of cohort and case-control studies. (2017)
“RESULTS: Six cohort studies involving 4506265 total first doses and five case-control studies involving a total sample of 9643 children were included in this analysis. The cohort data revealed that there was an associated increased risk of intussusception after the first 7days post first dose of the vaccine (RR:3.71, 95% CI:1.08-12.69) and after receiving all doses of the rotavirus vaccine (RR:3.47, 95% CI:1.23-9.78). Similarly, the case-control data found an increased risk of intussusception following the first dose (OR: 8.45, 95% CI: 4.08-17.50) and following all doses (OR: 1.59, 95% CI: 1.11-2.27).
CONCLUSIONS: Findings of this meta-analysis suggest that the rotavirus vaccine is associated with an increased risk on the development of intussusception, principally seen after administration of the first dose of vaccine.”

RotaTeq vaccine adverse events and policy considerations.
“RESULTS: From February 3, 2021 through July 31, 2007, a total of 160 (of the 165 reported) intussusception and 11 (of the 16 reported) Kawasaki disease adverse event reports were identified when RotaTeq was administered or co-administered with other vaccines. Time-trend analyses showed that there were significant increases in the total number of intussusception and Kawasaki disease adverse events entered into VAERS in comparison to previous years.
CONCLUSIONS: These observations, coupled with limited rotavirus disease burden, cost-effectiveness, and potential contact viral transmission concerns, raise serious questions regarding the use of RotaTeq in the US. Healthcare providers should diligently report adverse events following RotaTeq vaccination to VAERS, and those who have experienced a vaccine-associated adverse event should be made aware that they may be eligible for compensation from the no-fault National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP).”

                                Anaphylaxis following single component measles and rubella immunisation.
“Anaphylaxis as an adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) is a rare occurrence. We report four cases of anaphylaxis following administration of single component measles or rubella vaccine between January 2003 and June 2007. We estimate that the incidence of anaphylaxis to measles and rubella single component vaccines is 18.9 and 22.4 cases/100,000 doses, respectively. These figures are likely to be an underestimate but are higher than expected. Our calculations were hampered by lack of immunisation reporting data from the private sector. We recommend that NHS standards of vaccine data reporting are also applied to private clinics.”

Postpartum live virus vaccination: lessons from veterinary medicine.
“Pregnant rubella-susceptible women are often revaccinated during the postpartum period with the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella vaccine (MMR). It is known that the rubella virus from vaccine is secreted in breast milk and persists in the nose and throat for up to 28 days but it is not known whether the measles and mumps viruses are similarly secreted. It is probable the measles virus from vaccine is.”

ð [Vaccines, biotechnology and their connection with induced abortion].
“Diploid cells (WI-38, MRC-5) vaccines have their origin in induced abortions. Among these vaccines we fi nd the following: rubella, measles, mumps, rabies, polio, smallpox, hepatitis A, chickenpox, and herpes zoster. Nowadays, other abortion tainted vaccines cultivated on transformed cells (293, PER.C6) are in the pipeline: flu, Respiratory Syncytial and parainfluenza viruses, HIV, West Nile virus, Ebola, Marburg and Lassa, hepatitis B and C, foot and mouth disease, Japanese encephalitis, dengue, tuberculosis, anthrax, plague, tetanus and malaria. The same method is used for the production of monoclonal antibodies and other proteins, gene therapy and genomics. Technology enables us to develop the aforementioned products without resorting to induced abortion. Full disclosure of the cell origin in the labelling of vaccines and other products must be supported. There are vaccines from non-objectionable sources which should be made available to the public. When no alternative vaccines exist, ethical research must be promoted. Non-objectionable sources in the production of monoclonal antibodies, gene therapy and genomics must be encouraged. It is not be consistent to abstain from products originated in embryonic stem cells and at the same time approve of products obtained from induced abortions. It is of paramount importance to avoid that induced abortion technology seeps into every field of Medicine.”

ð [Complications of pertussis immunization (author transl)].
“16 cases of neurological disease and/or death shortly after pertussis immunization are reported. Eight patients had convulsions, six with ensuing permanent defects. Severe polymyositis was observed in one case. Five infants died 12 h to 4 days after vaccination: two after acute encephalopathy and three in the form of a sudden unexpected death (SID). In two fatal cases the morphological changes in the brain corresponded to those of pertussis encephalopathy: neuronal degeneration in various parts of the cortex, especially in the region of the ammons horn, and in the cerebellum. There were no signs of inflammation. Three cases underwent forensic autopsy and death was attributed to bronchopulmonary infection. Complete neuropathological work-up was only done in one case, in which the brain was normal. The critique of episodical reports and the demand for prospective studies is appreciated. Knowledge of all possible forms of complications, however, is indispensable for future investigations. Polymyositis and SID have so far not been listed as abnormal reactions to immunization. The majority of our cases became known accidentally from hospital sheets or from discussions with collegues. For a detection of all possible cases a greater awareness of doctors for the problem of pertussis immunization appears necessary. Only another 23 cases have been reported to the health authorities of the state of Lower Saxony during the last 6 to 7 years. Of those, nine were either harmless reactions or diseases probably unrelated to vaccination. Two were cases of SID, 12 and 72 h after vaccination. It is concluded that only a minor proportion of possible complications is presently reported to the health authorities.”

[Demyelinating disease and vaccination of the human papillomavirus].
“CASE REPORTS: We describe the cases of four young women that developed demyelinating disease after the vaccination of the HPV, with a rank of time between the administration of the dose and the development of the clinical of seven days to a month, with similar symptoms with the successive doses. We have described six episodes coinciding after the vaccination.
CONCLUSIONS: Have been described seizures, autoimmune disorders such as Guillain-Barre syndrome, transverse myelitis, or motor neuron disease, probably adverse effects following immunization by HPV vaccine. So we suggest that vaccine may trigger an immunological mechanism leading to demyelinating events, perhaps in predisposed young.”

Dravet syndrome with SCN1B gene mutation: A rare entity. (2017) 
“Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy has a grave outcome. Dravet syndrome (DS), characterized by early onset, refractory seizures, and intellectual deficit is one of the variants of the condition. SCN1B gene mutation is one of the lesser known variants of DS. Increased awareness of genetic analysis has increased the early diagnosis of DS for an early prognostication as well as genetic counselling of parents. We present the case of a 7-month old male child who started having recurrent febrile, and thereafter, afebrile seizures, following administration of a vaccination at 3 months. He developed global developmental delay, and is presently on multiple anticonvulsants. Genetic analysis was suggestive of SCN1B gene mutation associated with DS.”

[Neurologic manifestations following pertussis vaccination].
“Twenty cases of acute neurological complications occuring within 7 days of pertussis immunization are reported. Convulsions were present in every case and status epilepticus was observed in five infants. In only 4 cases were neurological or epileptic sequelae lacking. The clustering of neurological complications in the 24 hours following immunization is not consistent with the hypothesis of a mere temporal coincidence. However, the mechanism and incidence of post-immunization encephalopathies remains obscure and epidemiological studies are in order.”

Recurrent seizures after diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine immunization. Onset less than 24 hours after vaccination.
“Twenty-two patients with recurrent seizures that started less than 24 hours after immunization with diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP) vaccine were retrospectively studied. The initial seizure generally occurred after one of the first three DTP vaccine immunizations, and followed that immunization by less than 12 hours. Two of the 22 patients were siblings. Eight patients had additional immunizations with DTP vaccine and four had immediate worsening of their seizures. Of the 22 patients, only one was seizure free and stopped taking anticonvulsants. Three patients exhibited normal development, and 11 had severe developmental delays. Based on these observations, we reviewed current contraindications for immunization with pertussis vaccine.”

Status epilepticus and lymphocytic pneumonitis following hepatitis B vaccination.
“The case reported refers to a patient who developed status epilepticus in the day of her third dose of hepatitis B vaccination and we review the literature on this subject. A 12 year-old girl, without a relevant previous history, taking no drugs, developed a seizure attack followed by unconsciousness, and eventually died after three days of her third dose of hepatitis B (HB) vaccination. Autopsy study revealed cerebral edema with congestion and herniation and diffuse interstitial type pneumonitis. There seem to be a straight forward time relationship between the third HB vaccine, the event of convulsion and the sudden death of the patient. We suggest that, in some cases, vaccination may be the triggering factor for autoimmune and neurological disturbances in genetically predisposed individuals and physicians should be aware of this possible association.”

Use of the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register for vaccine safety data 
“An increase in febrile convulsions 6-11 days post-MMR vaccination was demonstrated which equates to a vaccine-attributable risk of 1 convulsion per 6753 vaccines. This study confirms the known association between MMR vaccination and febrile convulsions and in doing so demonstrates the feasibility of using the ACIR for data linkage and vaccine safety surveillance.”

Vaccine-related adverse events in Cuban children, 1999-2008.
“The DTwP vaccine exhibited the highest rate of adverse events. Common minor events were: fever (17,538), reactions at injection site (4470) and systemic side effects (2422). Rare events (by WHO definition) reported were: persistent crying (2666), hypotonic-hyporesponsive episodes (3), encephalopathy (2) and febrile seizures (112). Severe events included: anaphylaxis (2), respiratory distress (1), multiple organ failure (1), sudden death (1), vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (2), toxic shock syndrome (3), and sepsis (1). The 10 deaths and 3 cases of disability were investigated by an expert commission, which concluded that 8 of the 13 severe events were vaccination-related.”

Accidental vaccinia of the vulva.
“Vaccinia of the vulva in a 32-year-old married woman is described. The vaccination was apparently due to a heteroinoculation from her husband during sexual contact. Clinically it presented as an indurated ulcer with a few isolated umbilicated vesicles and was associated with an acute biological false-positive serological reactions.”

“On June 24, 2012, CDC notified Public Health Services, County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency, of a suspected case of vaccinia virus infection transmitted by sexual contact. The case had been reported to CDC by an infectious disease specialist who had requested vaccinia immune globulin intravenous (VIGIV) (Cangene Corporation, Berwyn, Pennsylvania) for a patient with lesions suspicious for vaccinia. The patient reported two recent sexual contacts: one with a partner who recently had been vaccinated against smallpox and a later encounter with an unvaccinated partner. Infections resulting from secondary transmission of vaccinia virus from the smallpox vaccinee to the patient and subsequent tertiary transmission of the virus from the patient to the unvaccinated partner were confirmed by the County of San Diego Public Health Laboratory. The smallpox vaccine had been administered under the U.S. Department of Defense smallpox vaccination program. The vaccinee did not experience vaccine-associated complications; however, the secondary and tertiary patients were hospitalized and treated with VIGIV. No further transmission was known to have occurred. This report describes the epidemiology and clinical course of the secondary and tertiary cases and efforts to prevent further transmission to contacts.”

Transmission of vaccinia virus, possibly through sexual contact, to a woman at high risk for adverse complications.
“Severe adverse events, including eczema vaccinatum (EV), can result after smallpox vaccination. Persons at risk for EV include those with underlying dermatologic conditions, such as atopic dermatitis. We investigated a case of vaccinia infection, possibly acquired during sexual contact with a recently vaccinated military service member, in a female Maryland resident with atopic dermatitis. The U.S. Department of Defenseâs Vaccine Healthcare Centers Network (VHCN) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) worked in conjunction with the patientâs physician and the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH) to confirm the diagnosis, ensure treatment, and prevent further transmission. Specimens collected from the patient were tested at the DHMH laboratories and were positive by real-time polymerase chain reaction for nonvariola orthopoxvirus. Testing at the CDC verified the presence of vaccinia-specific DNA signatures. Continuing spread of the patientâs lesions led to the administration of vaccinia immune globulin and strict infection control measures to prevent tertiary transmission to vulnerable family members, also with atopic dermatitis. VHCN contacted the service member to reinforce vaccination site care and hygiene. This case underscores the importance of prevaccination education for those receiving the smallpox vaccine to protect contacts at risk for developing severe adverse reactions.”

Vaccinia virus infection after sexual contact with a military smallpox vaccinee -Washington, 2010.
“On March 1, 2010, the Washington State Department of Health (WADOH) notified Public Health - Seattle &amp; King County (PHSKC) of a suspected case of contact transmission of vaccinia virus from sexual contact with a member of the military who had been vaccinated against smallpox. Vaccinia virus infection after sexual contact has been reported previously (1-4). Despite the patientâs exposure history and clinical presentation, the diagnosis initially was not considered by the patientâs physician, who ordered laboratory testing for several common sexually transmitted infections. The patient was seen by a second physician and referred to an infectious disease specialist, who obtained a swab sample of a genital lesion for laboratory testing for vaccinia virus. Vaccinia virus was confirmed by the Washington State Public Health Laboratory (WAPHL) and the CDC Poxvirus Laboratory. The patient resided in a household with an immunosuppressed renal transplant recipient. Appropriate contact precautions were recommended to the patient. No additional cases of contact transmission were reported. This report describes the patientâs clinical course and the associated epidemiologic investigation. Health-care providers caring for U.S. military personnel or their contacts should consider vaccinia virus infection in the differential diagnosis of clinically compatible genital lesions. Contact precautions should be emphasized to all persons who are vaccinated, as well as their contacts with unexplained lesions that might represent vaccinia infection from contact transmission.”

Vulvar vaccinia infection after sexual contact with a military smallpox vaccinee-Alaska, 2006.
“On October 10, 2006, an otherwise healthy woman visited a public health clinic in Alaska after vaginal tears that she had first experienced 10 days before became increasingly painful. The patient reported having a new male sex partner during September 22-October 1, 2006. A viral swab specimen from a labial lesion of the woman was submitted to the Alaska State Virology Laboratory (ASVL) for viral culture. The viral isolate could not be identified initially and subsequently was sent to CDC on January 9, 2007, where the isolate was identified as a vaccine-strain vaccinia virus. After vaccinia was identified, investigators interviewed the woman more closely and learned that her new sex partner was a male U.S. military service member stationed at a local military base. Further investigation determined that the service member had been vaccinated for smallpox 3 days before beginning his relationship with the woman. This report describes the clinical evaluation of the woman and laboratory testing performed to identify the isolate. Health-care providers should be aware of the possibility of vaccinia infection in persons with clinically compatible genital lesions who have had recent contact with smallpox vaccinees.”

Vulvar vaccinia infection after sexual contact with a smallpox vaccinee.
“The United States ceased generalized smallpox vaccination in 1972 but reinstated it in 2002 for military personnel and selected healthcare workers (first responders who may be investigating possible cases of smallpox or caring for patients in selected hospitals) after the 2001 bioterrorism attacks. Since reinstitution of the vaccine, reports of transmission of vaccinia virus through contact with military smallpox vaccinees have been published, including four cases of female genital infection. We report a subsequent case of vulvar vaccinia infection acquired during sexual contact with a military vaccinee.”

                                ð Elevated blood histamine caused by vaccinations and Vitamin C deficiency may mimic the shaken baby syndrome.
“The findings of subdural hematoma and retinal hemorrhages in infants, without any documented history of major trauma, do not always indicate child abuse. A combination of ascorbate depletion and the injection of foreign proteins can cause a very high blood histamine level, leading to capillary fragility and venular bleeding. This can be prevented by the administration of vitamin C.”

ð The evidence base for shaken baby syndrome
“There is every reason to believe that infant deaths following
vaccinations could be prevented or markedly reduced by the administration
of vitamin C before inoculations, instead of the more usual paracetamol
(4, 5). Not only will there be a decrease in the infant death rate; but
also an important reduction in the incidence of cerebral palsy, epilepsy,
cognitive and behavioural problems, and intellectual impairment, can be
expected.”

Abortive and subclinical poliomyelitis in a family during the 1992 epidemic in The Netherlands.
“We describe a case of abortive poliomyelitis due to poliovirus type 3 (PV3) in an unvaccinated woman and a subclinical poliovirus infection in her family during an epidemic in the Netherlands. The woman excreted the epidemic strain (PV3) for 7 weeks. Her two children received oral attenuated poliovirus vaccine and were subsequently found to excrete PV1 and PV2 vaccine strains in addition to the epidemic PV3 strain. Her husband, who had neutralizing antibodies to all three poliovirus types because of previous vaccination, initially excreted no virus; subsequently, however, the vaccine strain PV1 and the epidemic strain PV3 could be cultured from his feces.”

Characterisation of poxviruses from sporadic human infections.
“An orthopoxvirus was isolated from the vesicular rash of a man in Natal who died in coma and who had not been vaccinated. Analysis of the viral DNA showed that it was a vaccinia virus, more closely related to the virus of South African smallpox vaccine than to other vaccinia viruses.” 
“Minor biological differences between the viruses isolated and the corresponding vaccine strains suggested that some natural transmission of the virus had occurred, but the results of DNA analysis implied that they originated from the use of smallpox vaccine.”

Characteristics of poliovirus strains from long-term excretors with primary immunodeficiencies.
“Individuals who are deficient in humoral immunity are particularly at risk from infection with enteroviruses, and poliovirus in particular, where antibodies are the main source of protection from disease. Long-term excretion of vaccine strains of poliovirus has been documented for many years and instances of paralytic poliomyelitis in hypogammaglobulinaemic patients who were subsequently found to have been excreting virus for prolonged periods have been reported in the U.S.A., Germany and Japan. The identification of a healthy immunodeficient patient in the U.K. who has probably been excreting type 2 poliovirus for 15 years will be described, with the characteristics of the virus and the results of attempts at treatment so far. Such individuals pose a significant risk to the eradication programme unless they can be identified and treated.”

Chickenpox attributable to a vaccine virus contracted from a vaccinee with zoster.
“Five months after 2 siblings were immunized with varicella vaccine, 1 developed zoster. Two weeks later the second sibling got a mild case of chicken pox. Virus isolated from the latter was found to be vaccine type. Thus, the vaccine strain was transmitted from the vaccinee with zoster to his sibling. Vaccinees who later develop zoster must be considered contagious.”

Detection of Vaccinia DNA in the Blood Following Smallpox Vaccination
“To the Editor: Routine administration of the smallpox vaccine ended in the United States in 1972. With the reinitiation of the US smallpox vaccination program in 2002, the risk of transmission of vaccinia virus from a recently vaccinated person to a susceptible host is a concern. Secondary transmission is biologically plausible because of evidence of viral persistence in vaccinees. Vaccinia virus has been cultured from the oropharynx of vaccine recipients with a normal course following vaccination.1 In the 1960s and 1970s, it was isolated from the blood and urine of a limited number of vaccine recipients who had complications following vaccination.”

Eczema vaccinatum resulting from the transmission of vaccinia virus from a smallpox vaccinee: an investigation of potential fomites in the home environment.
“On March 3, 2007, a 2-year-old boy was hospitalized with eczema vaccinatum. His two siblings, one with eczema, were subsequently removed from the home. Swabs of household items obtained on March 13th were analyzed for orthopoxvirus DNA signatures with real-time PCR. Virus culture was attempted on positive specimens. Eight of 25 household samples were positive by PCR for orthopoxvirus; of these, three yielded viable vaccinia virus in culture. Both siblings were found to have serologic evidence of orthopoxvirus exposure.”

Effect of prior immunity on the shedding of virulent revertant virus in feces after oral immunization with live attenuated poliovirus vaccines.
“Groups of infants were immunized with one or two doses of orally inoculated live attenuated Sabin poliovirus vaccine (OPV group) or with one or two doses of enhanced-potency inactivated poliovirus vaccine (EIPV) administered parenterally followed by one or two doses of OPV (EIPV-OPV group). The fecal specimens from both groups were tested for poliovirus shedding 1-2 months after OPV. The virus isolates were examined for nucleic acid sequences in the 5′ noncoding regions (bases 480, 481, and 472 for serotypes 1, 2, and 3, respectively) to determine whether the viruses shed represented nonattenuated revertants, attenuated parent vaccine strains (nonrevertants), or both. In the OPV group, 4 of the 6 virus isolates recovered 30-60 days after the first immunization dose and 1 of the 3 isolates obtained after the second dose were found to be nonrevertants (parent vaccine strain). In contrast, 11 of the 12 isolates in the EIPV-OPV group were of the nonvaccine revertant virus types. The frequency for reversion appeared to differ for different poliovirus serotypes. However, all revertant type 3 isolates were recovered from subjects previously immunized with EIPV.”

“Eight outbreaks of paralytic polio attributable to circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) have highlighted the risks associated with oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) use in areas of low vaccination coverage and poor hygiene.” 
“Although only 114 virologically-confirmed paralytic cases were identified in the eight cVDPV outbreaks, it is likely that a minimum of hundreds of thousands, and more likely several million individuals were infected during these events, and that many thousands more have been infected by VDPV lineages within outbreaks which have escaped detection.”

Estimating the risk of re-emergence after stopping polio vaccination.
“As vaccinated hosts are natural reservoirs for virulent poliovirus, the source of the risk is the vaccination itself, employed to prevent the outbreaks.” 
“Our estimates for transmission, recovery, and mutation rates, show that the probability of an outbreak of vaccine-derived virulent viruses easily exceeds 90%. Moreover, if a small fraction of hosts have a longer infectious period, as observed in individuals with innate immunodeficiency, the risk of an outbreak rises significantly.”

Explosive school-based measles outbreak: intense exposure may have resulted in high risk, even among revaccinees.
“Even high levels of measles vaccination coverage have not always prevented outbreaks of measles spread by airborne transmission. It has been suggested that a large inoculum might increase vaccine failure risk. Airbome transmission might occasionally entail a large measles inoculum. The epidemiologic relevance of measles among properly vaccinated persons (i.e., those vaccinated after 15 months of age and with live attenuated virus) is increased when they become contagious. The authors studied inoculum intensities as measured by proxy variables and the contagiousness of properly vaccinated persons who contracted measles among 51 measles patients infected in one school, at home, or elsewhere, utilizing preexisting records of measles cases and 214 healthy controls from an explosive school outbreak that occurred in a rural Finnish municipality in 1989. One “super-spreader” infected 22 others in one day, including eight once-vaccinated students and one twice-vaccinated student, probably during an assembly of 144 students in a poorly ventilated hallway with no sunlight. Those infected later at home had high measles risk, even if they were revaccinees. When siblings shared a bedroom with a measles case, a 78 percent risk (seven out of nine children) was observed among vaccinees. Vaccinees had approximately 2 daysâ shorter incubation time than unvaccinated persons. Vaccinated and unvaccinated students were equally able to infect their siblings. Total protection against measles might not be achievable, even among revaccinees, when children are confronted with intense exposure to measles virus.”

“A report on vaccine-related deaths in the United States during the 1960s found that 12 of the 68 deaths occurred in unvaccinated persons exposed to recently vaccinated family members or friends, a finding that demonstrates the potential gravity of the problem.” 
“Numerous reports have described the spread of vaccinia virus within families. The majority are in- stances of single transmission, usually from a re- cently vaccinated child to an unvaccinated younger sibling.22-25 However, two or more secondary cas- es have been reported in at least eight reports of family outbreaks published from 1931 to 198126-33 (Table 2). Many of the reports describe severe, some- times fatal eczema vaccinatum in the first family member with secondary disease and substantially milder local inoculation disease in the rest of the family.”

“Is human exposure to veterinary vaccines a potential public health concern? There is currently limited understanding of the incidence of exposure of individuals to veterinary vaccines or of the consequences of such exposure. In addition, the potential for exposure and for adverse consequences secondary to exposure to veterinary vaccines may be increasing. The increased development and use of veterinary vaccines (including live vaccines), the increased aerosol administration of vaccines, and the increased proportion of individuals in the United States who are immunosuppressed and who may be exposed to these vaccines or to animals shedding the vaccine strains suggest that increased vigilance may be warranted.”

“To examine whether the live varicella vaccine virus is attenuated, we analyzed varicella vaccine-induced contact cases of clinical chickenpox in healthy siblings of immunized children with leukemia. A rash developed approximately 1 month later in 156 children with leukemia who had been vaccinated. Vaccine-type virus was isolated from 25 of these children. Of 88 known susceptible healthy siblings who were exposed to a vaccine with a rash and from whom follow-up information was available, there was evidence of infection in 15 (17%). Of 15 siblings with seroconversion, 11 (73%) also acquired a mild rash with an average of 38 lesions and no accompanying systemic symptoms. Vaccine-type virus was isolated from four of the contact siblings. Tertiary transmission was documented once. Contact siblings with seroconversion were protected during future household exposure to chickenpox, which occurred in four instances.”

Approximately 6-8 days after vaccination, he experienced a major reaction (i.e., an event that indicates a successful take; is characterized by a papule, vesicle, ulcer, or crusted lesion, surrounded by an area of induration; and usually results in a scar) (4). The vaccinee reported no substantial pruritus. He slept in the same bed as his wife and kept the vaccination site covered with bandages. After bathing, he reportedly dried the vaccination site with tissue, which he discarded into a trash receptacle. He also used separate towels to dry himself, rolled them so the area that dried his arm was inside, and placed them in a laundry container. His wife handled bed linen, soiled clothing, and towels; she reported that she did not see any obvious drainage on clothing or linen and had no direct contact with the vaccination site.
In mid-May, the wife had vesicular skin lesions on each breast near the areola but continued to breastfeed. Approximately 2 weeks later, she was examined at a local hospital, treated for mastitis, and continued to breastfeed. The same day, the infant had a vesicular lesion on the upper lip, followed by another lesion on the left cheek (5). Three days later, the infant was examined by a pediatrician, when another lesion was noted on her tongue. Because of possible early atopic dermatitis lesions on the infantâs cheeks, contact vaccinia infection with increased risk for eczema vaccinatum was considered. The infant was transferred to a military referral medical center for further evaluation. On examination, the infant had seborrheic dermatitis and no ocular involvement. Skin lesion specimens from the mother and infant tested positive for vaccinia by viral culture and PCR at the Alaska Health Department Laboratory and at Madigan Army Medical Center. Because both patients were stable clinically and the lesions were healing without risk for more serious complications, vaccinia immune globulin was not administered. Neither patient had systemic complications from the infection.
Case 2. In July 2003, a service member who had been vaccinated was wrestling with an unvaccinated service member at a military recreational function when the bandages covering the vaccination site fell off. The unvaccinated service member subsequently wrestled with another unvaccinated service member. Six days later, both unvaccinated service members had lesions on their forearms, neck, and face. Skin lesion specimens from both men tested positive for vaccinia virus by PCR and viral culture at Tripler Army Medical Centerâs microbiology laboratory.”

Secondary and tertiary transmission of vaccinia virus after sexual contact with a smallpox vaccinee-San Diego, California, 2012.
“On June 24, 2012, CDC notified Public Health Services, County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency, of a suspected case of vaccinia virus infection transmitted by sexual contact. The case had been reported to CDC by an infectious disease specialist who had requested vaccinia immune globulin intravenous (VIGIV) (Cangene Corporation, Berwyn, Pennsylvania) for a patient with lesions suspicious for vaccinia. The patient reported two recent sexual contacts: one with a partner who recently had been vaccinated against smallpox and a later encounter with an unvaccinated partner. Infections resulting from secondary transmission of vaccinia virus from the smallpox vaccinee to the patient and subsequent tertiary transmission of the virus from the patient to the unvaccinated partner were confirmed by the County of San Diego Public Health Laboratory. The smallpox vaccine had been administered under the U.S. Department of Defense smallpox vaccination program. The vaccinee did not experience vaccine-associated complications; however, the secondary and tertiary patients were hospitalized and treated with VIGIV. No further transmission was known to have occurred. This report describes the epidemiology and clinical course of the secondary and tertiary cases and efforts to prevent further transmission to contacts.”

Secondary transmission of varicella vaccine virus in a chronic care facility for children.
“A 16-year-old varicella-seronegative resident at a chronic care facility received varicella vaccine; 15 days later he developed severe varicella. Subsequently, a 13-year-old resident and a 39-year-old health care worker developed mild varicella. We demonstrate that vaccine-strain virus was transmitted to both persons, and that transmission included at least 2 variant vaccine strains.”

Shedding of virulent poliovirus revertants during immunization with oral poliovirus vaccine after prior immunization with inactivated polio vaccine.
“Fecal shedding of virulent revertant polioviruses was examined in isolates from infants previously immunized with &gt; or = 1 dose of orally administered live attenuated polio vaccine (OPV) alone, enhanced-potency inactivated polio vaccine (EIPV) alone, or a combination of both. After administration of OPV alone, vaccine poliovirus serotypes were recovered in feces within 1 week and for as long as 31-60 days in 30%-80% of subjects after 1 or 2 doses and in 30%-50% after immunization with &gt; or = 3 doses. No revertant poliovirus shedding was observed after OPV challenge in subjects immunized previously with &gt; or = 3 doses of OPV. However, fecal shedding of revertant poliovirus after OPV challenge was observed in 50%-100% of subjects previously immunized with &gt; or = 3 doses of the EIPV. These findings suggest that prior immunization with EIPV does not prevent fecal shedding of revertant polioviruses after subsequent reexposure to OPV.”

ð Spread of vaccinia virus through shaving during military training, Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland, TX, June 2014.
“Adverse events following smallpox vaccination may occur in the vaccinee, in individuals who have contact with the vaccinee (i.e., secondary transmission), or in individuals who have contact with the vaccineeâs contact (i.e., tertiary transmission). In June 2014 at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland, TX, two cases of inadvertent inoculation of vaccinia and one case of a non-viral reaction following vaccination occurred in the security forces training squadron. This includes the first reported case of shaving as the likely source of autoinoculation after contact transmission. This paper describes the diagnosis and treatment of these cases, the outbreak investigation, and steps taken to prevent future transmission.”

ST-246 inhibits in vivo poxvirus dissemination, virus shedding, and systemic disease manifestation.
“Here, we show that ST-246 treatment not only results in the significant inhibition of vaccinia virus dissemination from the site of inoculation to distal organs, such as the spleen and liver, but also reduces the viral load in organs targeted by the dissemination. In mice intranasally infected with vaccinia virus, virus shedding from the nasal and lung mucosa was significantly lower (approximately 22- and 528-fold, respectively) upon ST-246 treatment.”
“Second, by reducing virus shedding from those prophylactically immunized with a smallpox vaccine or harboring variola virus infection, ST-246 could reduce the risk of virus transmission to susceptible contacts.”

Characterization of isolates by both antigenic and molecular methods showed that, in all cases, the disease was associated with type 2 or 3 polioviruses of vaccine origin with retromutations known to be associated with loss of Sabin attenuated phenotype. Infection occurred despite the fact that all patients had records of previous immunization with oral polio vaccine (OPV), suggesting a failure of vaccination.â

Tertiary contact vaccinia in a breastfeeding infant. 2004. 
“The vaccinee reported observing all of the standard precautions to avoid household spread. In mid May, his breastfeeding wife developed vesicles on both areolas. On May 29, their infant daughter developed a papule on her philtrum. Contact vaccinia was confirmed by positive polymerase chain reaction and culture for vaccinia of both the maternal and infant lesions. This is the first documented case of inadvertent contact vaccinia transmission from a mother to her infant through direct skin-to-skin and skin-to-mucous membrane contact while breastfeeding. The mechanism of transfer from the vaccinee to the spouse is uncertain. This report demonstrates that breastfeeding infants living in close contact with smallpox vaccinees are at potential risk for contact vaccinia, even if the vaccinee is not the breastfeeding mother, and highlights the need for special precautions to prevent secondary transfer to breastfeeding mothers.”

? Transmission of mumps virus from mumps-vaccinated individuals to close contacts.
“During a recent mumps epidemic in the Netherlands caused by a genotype D mumps virus strain, we investigated the potential of vaccinated people to spread mumps disease to close contacts. We compared mumps viral titers of oral fluid specimens obtained by quantitative PCR from vaccinated (n=60) and unvaccinated (n=111) mumps patients. We also investigated the occurrence of mumps infection among the household contacts of vaccinated mumps patients. We found that viral titers are higher for unvaccinated patients than for vaccinated patients during the 1st 3 days after onset of disease. While no symptomatic cases were reported among the household contacts (n=164) of vaccinated mumps patients (n=36), there were cases with serological evidence of asymptomatic infection among vaccinated household contacts (9 of 66 vaccinated siblings). For two of these siblings, the vaccinated index patient was the most probable source of infection. We conclude that, in this particular outbreak, the risk of a close contact becoming infected by vaccinated patients was small, but present.

Transmission of vaccinia virus, possibly through sexual contact, to a woman at high risk for adverse complications.
“Severe adverse events, including eczema vaccinatum (EV), can result after smallpox vaccination. Persons at risk for EV include those with underlying dermatologic conditions, such as atopic dermatitis. We investigated a case of vaccinia infection, possibly acquired during sexual contact with a recently vaccinated military service member, in a female Maryland resident with atopic dermatitis. The U.S. Department of Defenseâs Vaccine Healthcare Centers Network (VHCN) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) worked in conjunction with the patientâs physician and the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH) to confirm the diagnosis, ensure treatment, and prevent further transmission. Specimens collected from the patient were tested at the DHMH laboratories and were positive by real-time polymerase chain reaction for nonvariola orthopoxvirus. Testing at the CDC verified the presence of vaccinia-specific DNA signatures. Continuing spread of the patientâs lesions led to the administration of vaccinia immune globulin and strict infection control measures to prevent tertiary transmission to vulnerable family members, also with atopic dermatitis. VHCN contacted the service member to reinforce vaccination site care and hygiene. This case underscores the importance of prevaccination education for those receiving the smallpox vaccine to protect contacts at risk for developing severe adverse reactions.”

Unintentional transfer of vaccinia virus associated with smallpox vaccines: ACAM2000(Â®) compared with Dryvax(Â®).
“We identified 309 reports for ACAM2000Â® with skin or ocular involvement, of which 93 were autoinoculation cases and 20 were contact transmission cases. The rate for reported cases of autoinoculation was 20.6 per 100,000 vaccinations and for contact transmission was 4.4 per 100,000 vaccinations. Eighteen contact transmission cases could be attributed to contact during a sporting activity (45%) or intimate contact (45%). Of the 113 unintentional transfer cases, 6 met the case definition for ocular vaccinia. The most common locations for all autoinoculation and contact cases were arm/elbow/shoulder (35/113; 31%) and face (24/113; 21%). Methods We reviewed 753 reports associated with smallpox in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System and CDC Poxvirus consultation log, reported from March 2008 to August 2010.

Use of a novel real-time PCR assay to detect oral polio vaccine shedding and reversion in stool and sewage samples after a mexican national immunization day.
“During replication, oral polio vaccine (OPV) can revert to neurovirulence and cause paralytic poliomyelitis. In individual vaccinees, it can acquire specific revertant point mutations, leading to vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP). With longer replication, OPV can mutate into vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV), which causes poliomyelitis outbreaks similar to those caused by wild poliovirus. After wild poliovirus eradication, safely phasing out vaccination will likely require global use of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) until cessation of OPV circulation.”

Vaccine-associated contact paralytic poliomyelitis with atypical neurological presentation.

Symmetrical lower motor neuron involvement of deltoid muscles with electromyographic confirmation was found. Upper motor neuron signs, with symmetrical hyperactive deep tendon reflexes developed in the lower extremities. Poliovirus Type-2 vaccine-like strain was cultured from one patient and both patients showed significant antibody titers rises to poliovirus. Attention is drawn to the possible clinical differences between vaccine associated poliomelitis and the usual features found in wild strain poliomyelitis. It is suggested that in selected cases, non-immunized contacts be given inactivated polio-vaccine when the vaccinees are immunized with the live oral-vaccine.â

The epidemic followed small-scale trials with Sabin and USOL-D-bac type 3 vaccine strains carried out in seven countries including Poland. Factors that might have contributed to the genesis and development of the epidemic were the pattern of virus excretion from vaccinees, mutations found in viruses from the epidemic, and the particular vaccination policies in Poland during the previous years.”

“Results of virological examination of 239 samples taken from 84 children with neurological complications after smallpox vaccination are described. In postvaccinal encephalitis, vaccinia virus was isolated from blood, cerebrospinal fluid and pharyngeal secretions of 23 out of 40 children (57.5%) as well as from autopsy specimens sampled between 10-35 days after vaccination. During the acute period of disease, virus was detected in 17 out of 31 (54.2%) cerebrospinal fluid specimens. In 3 postvaccinal encephalitis cases the virus was present in brain and in a case of encephalomyelitis-in the spinal cord. These results confirmed the participation of vaccinia virus in the pathogenesis of postvaccinal encephalitis. The pathogenicity of vaccinia virus may be manifested only under a changed reactivity of the vaccinated host.”

Vaccinia virus infection after sexual contact with a military smallpox vaccinee -Washington, 2010.
“On March 1, 2010, the Washington State Department of Health (WADOH) notified Public Health - Seattle &amp; King County (PHSKC) of a suspected case of contact transmission of vaccinia virus from sexual contact with a member of the military who had been vaccinated against smallpox. Vaccinia virus infection after sexual contact has been reported previously (1-4). Despite the patientâs exposure history and clinical presentation, the diagnosis initially was not considered by the patientâs physician, who ordered laboratory testing for several common sexually transmitted infections. The patient was seen by a second physician and referred to an infectious disease specialist, who obtained a swab sample of a genital lesion for laboratory testing for vaccinia virus. Vaccinia virus was confirmed by the Washington State Public Health Laboratory (WAPHL) and the CDC Poxvirus Laboratory. The patient resided in a household with an immunosuppressed renal transplant recipient. Appropriate contact precautions were recommended to the patient. No additional cases of contact transmission were reported. This report describes the patientâs clinical course and the associated epidemiologic investigation. Health-care providers caring for U.S. military personnel or their contacts should consider vaccinia virus infection in the differential diagnosis of clinically compatible genital lesions. Contact precautions should be emphasized to all persons who are vaccinated, as well as their contacts with unexplained lesions that might represent vaccinia infection from contact transmission.”

Vaccinia virus infections in martial arts gym, Maryland, USA, 2008.
“Vaccinia virus is an orthopoxvirus used in the live vaccine against smallpox. Vaccinia virus infections can be transmissible and can cause severe complications in those with weakened immune systems. We report on a cluster of 4 cases of vaccinia virus infection in Maryland, USA, likely acquired at a martial arts gym.”

Vulvar vaccinia infection after sexual contact with a military smallpox vaccinee-Alaska, 2006.
“On October 10, 2006, an otherwise healthy woman visited a public health clinic in Alaska after vaginal tears that she had first experienced 10 days before became increasingly painful. The patient reported having a new male sex partner during September 22-October 1, 2006. A viral swab specimen from a labial lesion of the woman was submitted to the Alaska State Virology Laboratory (ASVL) for viral culture. The viral isolate could not be identified initially and subsequently was sent to CDC on January 9, 2007, where the isolate was identified as a vaccine-strain vaccinia virus. After vaccinia was identified, investigators interviewed the woman more closely and learned that her new sex partner was a male U.S. military service member stationed at a local military base. Further investigation determined that the service member had been vaccinated for smallpox 3 days before beginning his relationship with the woman. This report describes the clinical evaluation of the woman and laboratory testing performed to identify the isolate. Health-care providers should be aware of the possibility of vaccinia infection in persons with clinically compatible genital lesions who have had recent contact with smallpox vaccinees.”

Vulvar vaccinia infection after sexual contact with a smallpox vaccinee.
“The United States ceased generalized smallpox vaccination in 1972 but reinstated it in 2002 for military personnel and selected healthcare workers (first responders who may be investigating possible cases of smallpox or caring for patients in selected hospitals) after the 2001 bioterrorism attacks. Since reinstitution of the vaccine, reports of transmission of vaccinia virus through contact with military smallpox vaccinees have been published, including four cases of female genital infection. We report a subsequent case of vulvar vaccinia infection acquired during sexual contact with a military vaccinee.”

What is the cause of a rash after measles-mumps-rubella vaccination?
“We describe a 17-month-old child with fever and rash after measles-mumps-rubella vaccination. Detection of vaccine-strain
measles virus in his urine by poly
merase chain reaction confirmed the diagnosis of a vaccine reaction rather than wild-type measles. We propose that measles virus should be sought and identified as vaccine or wild-type virus when the relationship between vaccination and measles-like illness is uncertain.”

Widespread eczema vaccinatum acquired by contacts. A report of an autopsy case
“A 4-month-old male infant predisposed to allergic dermatitis acquired wide-spread eczema vaccinatum by contacts with a recently vaccinated sibling. He died of acute purulent peritonitis following a perforation of multiple duodenal ulcers. Fluorescence immunocytochemical and electron microscopic studies on the skin lesions revealed the presence of viral antigens and numerous virus particles compatible morphologically with those of the mature form from the same batch of smallpox vaccine given to the sibling. A large number of virus particles in the developmental form were also predominantly scattered in the cytoplasm of cells at the stratum malpighii of the epidermis as well as in neutrophils and macrophages in the skin lesions. The virus isolation from the skin lesions was done by using the HeLa cells and the human embryonic lung fibroblasts. No abnormal laboratory data were noted in immunoglobulins. On the basis of atrophy of the thymus and other lymphatic tissues and an appearance of large pyroninophilic cells in association with blastoid transformation, the authors discussed a possible participation of the disturbance of cellular immunity secondary to the virus infection in the development of the disease.”

“Gelatin and other nonprimate mammalâderived products are common excipient ingredients in several vaccines, and it has been postulated that patients with alpha-gal allergy might react to these vaccines.”

Chickenpox attributable to a vaccine virus contracted from a vaccinee with zoster.
“Five months after 2 siblings were immunized with varicella vaccine, 1 developed zoster. Two weeks later the second sibling got a mild case of chicken pox. Virus isolated from the latter was found to be vaccine type. Thus, the vaccine strain was transmitted from the vaccinee with zoster to his sibling. Vaccinees who later develop zoster must be considered contagious.”

ð [Vaccines, biotechnology and their connection with induced abortion].
“Diploid cells (WI-38, MRC-5) vaccines have their origin in induced abortions. Among these vaccines we fi nd the following: rubella, measles, mumps, rabies, polio, smallpox, hepatitis A, chickenpox, and herpes zoster. Nowadays, other abortion tainted vaccines cultivated on transformed cells (293, PER.C6) are in the pipeline: flu, Respiratory Syncytial and parainfluenza viruses, HIV, West Nile virus, Ebola, Marburg and Lassa, hepatitis B and C, foot and mouth disease, Japanese encephalitis, dengue, tuberculosis, anthrax, plague, tetanus and malaria. The same method is used for the production of monoclonal antibodies and other proteins, gene therapy and genomics. Technology enables us to develop the aforementioned products without resorting to induced abortion. Full disclosure of the cell origin in the labelling of vaccines and other products must be supported. There are vaccines from non-objectionable sources which should be made available to the public. When no alternative vaccines exist, ethical research must be promoted. Non-objectionable sources in the production of monoclonal antibodies, gene therapy and genomics must be encouraged. It is not be consistent to abstain from products originated in embryonic stem cells and at the same time approve of products obtained from induced abortions. It is of paramount importance to avoid that induced abortion technology seeps into every field of Medicine.”

“Vaccinia of the vulva in a 32-year-old married woman is described. The vaccination was apparently due to a heteroinoculation from her husband during sexual contact. Clinically it presented as an indurated ulcer with a few isolated umbilicated vesicles and was associated with an acute biological false-positive serological reactions.”

There was no history nor skin changes suggestive of significant sun exposure. The histological examination of an initial biopsy and of the subsequently excised lesion revealed a basal cell carcinoma of the solid type.”

Characterisation of poxviruses from sporadic human infections.
“An orthopoxvirus was isolated from the vesicular rash of a man in Natal who died in coma and who had not been vaccinated. Analysis of the viral DNA showed that it was a vaccinia virus, more closely related to the virus of South African smallpox vaccine than to other vaccinia viruses.” 
“Minor biological differences between the viruses isolated and the corresponding vaccine strains suggested that some natural transmission of the virus had occurred, but the results of DNA analysis implied that they originated from the use of smallpox vaccine.”

Detection of Vaccinia DNA in the Blood Following Smallpox Vaccination
“To the Editor: Routine administration of the smallpox vaccine ended in the United States in 1972. With the reinitiation of the US smallpox vaccination program in 2002, the risk of transmission of vaccinia virus from a recently vaccinated person to a susceptible host is a concern. Secondary transmission is biologically plausible because of evidence of viral persistence in vaccinees. Vaccinia virus has been cultured from the oropharynx of vaccine recipients with a normal course following vaccination.1 In the 1960s and 1970s, it was isolated from the blood and urine of a limited number of vaccine recipients who had complications following vaccination.”

Eczema vaccinatum resulting from the transmission of vaccinia virus from a smallpox vaccinee: an investigation of potential fomites in the home environment.
“On March 3, 2007, a 2-year-old boy was hospitalized with eczema vaccinatum. His two siblings, one with eczema, were subsequently removed from the home. Swabs of household items obtained on March 13th were analyzed for orthopoxvirus DNA signatures with real-time PCR. Virus culture was attempted on positive specimens. Eight of 25 household samples were positive by PCR for orthopoxvirus; of these, three yielded viable vaccinia virus in culture. Both siblings were found to have serologic evidence of orthopoxvirus exposure.”

How Contagious Is Vaccinia?
“A report on vaccine-related deaths in the United States during the 1960s found that 12 of the 68 deaths occurred in unvaccinated persons exposed to recently vaccinated family members or friends, a finding that demonstrates the potential gravity of the problem.” 
“Numerous reports have described the spread of vaccinia virus within families. The majority are in- stances of single transmission, usually from a re- cently vaccinated child to an unvaccinated younger sibling.22-25 However, two or more secondary cas- es have been reported in at least eight reports of family outbreaks published from 1931 to 198126-33 (Table 2). Many of the reports describe severe, some- times fatal eczema vaccinatum in the first family member with secondary disease and substantially milder local inoculation disease in the rest of the family.”

Jonathan Hutchinson on Vaccination Syphilis 
“A century ago, even as today, the opponents of compulsory vaccination for smallpox argued that the complications of the procedure might be worse than the disease. One of the most resolute advocates of compulsory vaccination at the time was Jonathan Hutchinson, then a newly elected honorary member of the New York Dermatological society. Hutchinson made no secret of his contempt for the misguided zealots who supported the antivaccination movement. One may well imagine, therefore, how painful it must have been for him to report in detail his findings on the transmission of syphilis by arm-to-arm vaccination. Hutchinson met the problem with characteristic courage. How he did so is summarized in this article.”

Malignant Tumors as a Late Complication of Vaccination
“Four basal and one squamous cell carcinomas and a single instance of a malignant melanoma arising in vaccination scars have occurred in five southern California patients. Sun exposure on a previously scarred skin was the main etiological factor in the development of the basal and squamous cell tumors. Sun exposure was probably unimportant in the case of the melanoma because of the short time interval between vaccination and the development of the tumor.”

Malignant tumors in smallpox vaccination scars: a report of 24 cases.
“A study of 24 patients with proved malignant tumors originating in smallpox vaccination scars is reported. Three different tumor types were foundâmalignant melanomas, basal cell carcinomas, and squamous cell carcinomas. There was no exposure to known chemical carcinogens. In most cases a primary vaccination site was involved. The period of time between the vaccination and appearance of the malignant tumor was highly variable. Twenty-three of the patients were from various regions of the United States and one from the Republic of South Africa. Two patients presented tumors in vaccination sites bilaterally.
The possible role of vaccinia virus in the present cases is unknown and difficult to conceive. However, it is suggested that additional clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory studies should be made to determine the role, if any, of vaccinia virus in the development of malignant tumors in man.”

Progressive vaccinia in a military smallpox vaccinee - United States, 2009.
“Progressive vaccinia (PV), previously known as vaccinia necrosum, vaccinia gangrenosum, or disseminated vaccinia, is a rare, often fatal adverse event after vaccination with smallpox vaccine, which is made from live vaccinia virus. During recent vaccination programs potential cases of PV were investigated, but none met standard case definitions. PV has not been confirmed to have occurred in the United States since 1987. On March 2, 2009, a U.S. Navy Hospital contacted the Poxvirus Program at CDC to report a possible case of PV in a male military smallpox vaccinee. The service member had been newly diagnosed with acute mylegenous leukemia M0 (AML M0). During evaluation for a chemotherapy-induced neutropenic fever, he was found to have an expanding and nonhealing painless vaccination site 6.5 weeks after receipt of smallpox vaccine.”

Secondary and tertiary transmission of vaccinia virus after sexual contact with a smallpox vaccinee-San Diego, California, 2012.
“On June 24, 2012, CDC notified Public Health Services, County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency, of a suspected case of vaccinia virus infection transmitted by sexual contact. The case had been reported to CDC by an infectious disease specialist who had requested vaccinia immune globulin intravenous (VIGIV) (Cangene Corporation, Berwyn, Pennsylvania) for a patient with lesions suspicious for vaccinia. The patient reported two recent sexual contacts: one with a partner who recently had been vaccinated against smallpox and a later encounter with an unvaccinated partner. Infections resulting from secondary transmission of vaccinia virus from the smallpox vaccinee to the patient and subsequent tertiary transmission of the virus from the patient to the unvaccinated partner were confirmed by the County of San Diego Public Health Laboratory. The smallpox vaccine had been administered under the U.S. Department of Defense smallpox vaccination program. The vaccinee did not experience vaccine-associated complications; however, the secondary and tertiary patients were hospitalized and treated with VIGIV. No further transmission was known to have occurred. This report describes the epidemiology and clinical course of the secondary and tertiary cases and efforts to prevent further transmission to contacts.”

Secondary and Tertiary Transfer of Vaccinia Virus Among U.S. Military Personnel — United States and Worldwide, 2002-2004
“Case 1. In early May 2003, a service member received his primary smallpox vaccination. Approximately 6-8 days after vaccination, he experienced a major reaction (i.e., an event that indicates a successful take; is characterized by a papule, vesicle, ulcer, or crusted lesion, surrounded by an area of induration; and usually results in a scar) (4). The vaccinee reported no substantial pruritus. He slept in the same bed as his wife and kept the vaccination site covered with bandages. After bathing, he reportedly dried the vaccination site with tissue, which he discarded into a trash receptacle. He also used separate towels to dry himself, rolled them so the area that dried his arm was inside, and placed them in a laundry container. His wife handled bed linen, soiled clothing, and towels; she reported that she did not see any obvious drainage on clothing or linen and had no direct contact with the vaccination site.
In mid-May, the wife had vesicular skin lesions on each breast near the areola but continued to breastfeed. Approximately 2 weeks later, she was examined at a local hospital, treated for mastitis, and continued to breastfeed. The same day, the infant had a vesicular lesion on the upper lip, followed by another lesion on the left cheek (5). Three days later, the infant was examined by a pediatrician, when another lesion was noted on her tongue. Because of possible early atopic dermatitis lesions on the infantâs cheeks, contact vaccinia infection with increased risk for eczema vaccinatum was considered. The infant was transferred to a military referral medical center for further evaluation. On examination, the infant had seborrheic dermatitis and no ocular involvement. Skin lesion specimens from the mother and infant tested positive for vaccinia by viral culture and PCR at the Alaska Health Department Laboratory and at Madigan Army Medical Center. Because both patients were stable clinically and the lesions were healing without risk for more serious complications, vaccinia immune globulin was not administered. Neither patient had systemic complications from the infection.
Case 2. In July 2003, a service member who had been vaccinated was wrestling with an unvaccinated service member at a military recreational function when the bandages covering the vaccination site fell off. The unvaccinated service member subsequently wrestled with another unvaccinated service member. Six days later, both unvaccinated service members had lesions on their forearms, neck, and face. Skin lesion specimens from both men tested positive for vaccinia virus by PCR and viral culture at Tripler Army Medical Centerâs microbiology laboratory.”

ð Spread of vaccinia virus through shaving during military training, Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland, TX, June 2014.
“Adverse events following smallpox vaccination may occur in the vaccinee, in individuals who have contact with the vaccinee (i.e., secondary transmission), or in individuals who have contact with the vaccineeâs contact (i.e., tertiary transmission). In June 2014 at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland, TX, two cases of inadvertent inoculation of vaccinia and one case of a non-viral reaction following vaccination occurred in the security forces training squadron. This includes the first reported case of shaving as the likely source of autoinoculation after contact transmission. This paper describes the diagnosis and treatment of these cases, the outbreak investigation, and steps taken to prevent future transmission.”

ST-246 inhibits in vivo poxvirus dissemination, virus shedding, and systemic disease manifestation.
“Here, we show that ST-246 treatment not only results in the significant inhibition of vaccinia virus dissemination from the site of inoculation to distal organs, such as the spleen and liver, but also reduces the viral load in organs targeted by the dissemination. In mice intranasally infected with vaccinia virus, virus shedding from the nasal and lung mucosa was significantly lower (approximately 22- and 528-fold, respectively) upon ST-246 treatment.”
“Second, by reducing virus shedding from those prophylactically immunized with a smallpox vaccine or harboring variola virus infection, ST-246 could reduce the risk of virus transmission to susceptible contacts.”

Tertiary contact vaccinia in a breastfeeding infant. 2004. 
“The vaccinee reported observing all of the standard precautions to avoid household spread. In mid May, his breastfeeding wife developed vesicles on both areolas. On May 29, their infant daughter developed a papule on her philtrum. Contact vaccinia was confirmed by positive polymerase chain reaction and culture for vaccinia of both the maternal and infant lesions. This is the first documented case of inadvertent contact vaccinia transmission from a mother to her infant through direct skin-to-skin and skin-to-mucous membrane contact while breastfeeding. The mechanism of transfer from the vaccinee to the spouse is uncertain. This report demonstrates that breastfeeding infants living in close contact with smallpox vaccinees are at potential risk for contact vaccinia, even if the vaccinee is not the breastfeeding mother, and highlights the need for special precautions to prevent secondary transfer to breastfeeding mothers.”

Transmission of vaccinia virus, possibly through sexual contact, to a woman at high risk for adverse complications.
“Severe adverse events, including eczema vaccinatum (EV), can result after smallpox vaccination. Persons at risk for EV include those with underlying dermatologic conditions, such as atopic dermatitis. We investigated a case of vaccinia infection, possibly acquired during sexual contact with a recently vaccinated military service member, in a female Maryland resident with atopic dermatitis. The U.S. Department of Defenseâs Vaccine Healthcare Centers Network (VHCN) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) worked in conjunction with the patientâs physician and the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH) to confirm the diagnosis, ensure treatment, and prevent further transmission. Specimens collected from the patient were tested at the DHMH laboratories and were positive by real-time polymerase chain reaction for nonvariola orthopoxvirus. Testing at the CDC verified the presence of vaccinia-specific DNA signatures. Continuing spread of the patientâs lesions led to the administration of vaccinia immune globulin and strict infection control measures to prevent tertiary transmission to vulnerable family members, also with atopic dermatitis. VHCN contacted the service member to reinforce vaccination site care and hygiene. This case underscores the importance of prevaccination education for those receiving the smallpox vaccine to protect contacts at risk for developing severe adverse reactions.”

Unintentional transfer of vaccinia virus associated with smallpox vaccines: ACAM2000(Â®) compared with Dryvax(Â®).
“We identified 309 reports for ACAM2000Â® with skin or ocular involvement, of which 93 were autoinoculation cases and 20 were contact transmission cases. The rate for reported cases of autoinoculation was 20.6 per 100,000 vaccinations and for contact transmission was 4.4 per 100,000 vaccinations. Eighteen contact transmission cases could be attributed to contact during a sporting activity (45%) or intimate contact (45%). Of the 113 unintentional transfer cases, 6 met the case definition for ocular vaccinia. The most common locations for all autoinoculation and contact cases were arm/elbow/shoulder (35/113; 31%) and face (24/113; 21%). Methods We reviewed 753 reports associated with smallpox in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System and CDC Poxvirus consultation log, reported from March 2008 to August 2010.

ð [Vaccines, biotechnology and their connection with induced abortion].
“Diploid cells (WI-38, MRC-5) vaccines have their origin in induced abortions. Among these vaccines we fi nd the following: rubella, measles, mumps, rabies, polio, smallpox, hepatitis A, chickenpox, and herpes zoster. Nowadays, other abortion tainted vaccines cultivated on transformed cells (293, PER.C6) are in the pipeline: flu, Respiratory Syncytial and parainfluenza viruses, HIV, West Nile virus, Ebola, Marburg and Lassa, hepatitis B and C, foot and mouth disease, Japanese encephalitis, dengue, tuberculosis, anthrax, plague, tetanus and malaria. The same method is used for the production of monoclonal antibodies and other proteins, gene therapy and genomics. Technology enables us to develop the aforementioned products without resorting to induced abortion. Full disclosure of the cell origin in the labelling of vaccines and other products must be supported. There are vaccines from non-objectionable sources which should be made available to the public. When no alternative vaccines exist, ethical research must be promoted. Non-objectionable sources in the production of monoclonal antibodies, gene therapy and genomics must be encouraged. It is not be consistent to abstain from products originated in embryonic stem cells and at the same time approve of products obtained from induced abortions. It is of paramount importance to avoid that induced abortion technology seeps into every field of Medicine.”

Vaccinia virus infection after sexual contact with a military smallpox vaccinee -Washington, 2010.
“On March 1, 2010, the Washington State Department of Health (WADOH) notified Public Health - Seattle &amp; King County (PHSKC) of a suspected case of contact transmission of vaccinia virus from sexual contact with a member of the military who had been vaccinated against smallpox. Vaccinia virus infection after sexual contact has been reported previously (1-4). Despite the patientâs exposure history and clinical presentation, the diagnosis initially was not considered by the patientâs physician, who ordered laboratory testing for several common sexually transmitted infections. The patient was seen by a second physician and referred to an infectious disease specialist, who obtained a swab sample of a genital lesion for laboratory testing for vaccinia virus. Vaccinia virus was confirmed by the Washington State Public Health Laboratory (WAPHL) and the CDC Poxvirus Laboratory. The patient resided in a household with an immunosuppressed renal transplant recipient. Appropriate contact precautions were recommended to the patient. No additional cases of contact transmission were reported. This report describes the patientâs clinical course and the associated epidemiologic investigation. Health-care providers caring for U.S. military personnel or their contacts should consider vaccinia virus infection in the differential diagnosis of clinically compatible genital lesions. Contact precautions should be emphasized to all persons who are vaccinated, as well as their contacts with unexplained lesions that might represent vaccinia infection from contact transmission.”

Vaccinia virus infections in martial arts gym, Maryland, USA, 2008.
“Vaccinia virus is an orthopoxvirus used in the live vaccine against smallpox. Vaccinia virus infections can be transmissible and can cause severe complications in those with weakened immune systems. We report on a cluster of 4 cases of vaccinia virus infection in Maryland, USA, likely acquired at a martial arts gym.”

Vaccinia virus in postvaccinal encephalitis.
“Results of virological examination of 239 samples taken from 84 children with neurological complications after smallpox vaccination are described. In postvaccinal encephalitis, vaccinia virus was isolated from blood, cerebrospinal fluid and pharyngeal secretions of 23 out of 40 children (57.5%) as well as from autopsy specimens sampled between 10-35 days after vaccination. During the acute period of disease, virus was detected in 17 out of 31 (54.2%) cerebrospinal fluid specimens. In 3 postvaccinal encephalitis cases the virus was present in brain and in a case of encephalomyelitis-in the spinal cord. These results confirmed the participation of vaccinia virus in the pathogenesis of postvaccinal encephalitis. The pathogenicity of vaccinia virus may be manifested only under a changed reactivity of the vaccinated host.”

Vulvar vaccinia infection after sexual contact with a military smallpox vaccinee-Alaska, 2006.
“On October 10, 2006, an otherwise healthy woman visited a public health clinic in Alaska after vaginal tears that she had first experienced 10 days before became increasingly painful. The patient reported having a new male sex partner during September 22-October 1, 2006. A viral swab specimen from a labial lesion of the woman was submitted to the Alaska State Virology Laboratory (ASVL) for viral culture. The viral isolate could not be identified initially and subsequently was sent to CDC on January 9, 2007, where the isolate was identified as a vaccine-strain vaccinia virus. After vaccinia was identified, investigators interviewed the woman more closely and learned that her new sex partner was a male U.S. military service member stationed at a local military base. Further investigation determined that the service member had been vaccinated for smallpox 3 days before beginning his relationship with the woman. This report describes the clinical evaluation of the woman and laboratory testing performed to identify the isolate. Health-care providers should be aware of the possibility of vaccinia infection in persons with clinically compatible genital lesions who have had recent contact with smallpox vaccinees.”

Vulvar vaccinia infection after sexual contact with a smallpox vaccinee.
“The United States ceased generalized smallpox vaccination in 1972 but reinstated it in 2002 for military personnel and selected healthcare workers (first responders who may be investigating possible cases of smallpox or caring for patients in selected hospitals) after the 2001 bioterrorism attacks. Since reinstitution of the vaccine, reports of transmission of vaccinia virus through contact with military smallpox vaccinees have been published, including four cases of female genital infection. We report a subsequent case of vulvar vaccinia infection acquired during sexual contact with a military vaccinee.”

Widespread eczema vaccinatum acquired by contacts. A report of an autopsy case
“A 4-month-old male infant predisposed to allergic dermatitis acquired wide-spread eczema vaccinatum by contacts with a recently vaccinated sibling. He died of acute purulent peritonitis following a perforation of multiple duodenal ulcers. Fluorescence immunocytochemical and electron microscopic studies on the skin lesions revealed the presence of viral antigens and numerous virus particles compatible morphologically with those of the mature form from the same batch of smallpox vaccine given to the sibling. A large number of virus particles in the developmental form were also predominantly scattered in the cytoplasm of cells at the stratum malpighii of the epidermis as well as in neutrophils and macrophages in the skin lesions. The virus isolation from the skin lesions was done by using the HeLa cells and the human embryonic lung fibroblasts. No abnormal laboratory data were noted in immunoglobulins. On the basis of atrophy of the thymus and other lymphatic tissues and an appearance of large pyroninophilic cells in association with blastoid transformation, the authors discussed a possible participation of the disturbance of cellular immunity secondary to the virus infection in the development of the disease.”

The XIX century smallpox prevention in Naples and the risk of transmission of human blood-related pathogens.
“Although Galbiati established the retro-vaccination (1803) and developed the “calf” lymph vaccine, recognized and implemented since 1864 as the optimal smallpox vaccine in the following hundred years, Naples general population was mainly vaccinated with “human” lymph from abandoned children until 1893. Mini-epidemics of syphilis and serum hepatitis were periodically reported as results of arm-to-arm procedure. The risk of transmission of blood-related pathogens was higher in Naples where &gt;80% of abandoned children, used as repository of cowpox virus, were dying in their first year of life.”

                                Ischaemic stroke and influenza A H1N1 vaccination: a case report.
“We report a 75-year-old male patient who suffered posterior circulation ischaemia after influenza A/H1N1 vaccination. Vaccination provokes a variable magnitude of inflammatory and immunological response that modifies the risk for ischaemic stroke. Whereas a causal relation between vaccination and ischaemic stroke is still unsettled, an inflammatory/immunological response after vaccination may trigger thrombosis superimposing a pre-existing prothrombotic state. Careful monitoring is strongly suggested for individuals who received H1N1 vaccine, especially those with high ischaemic stroke risk.”

Adverse events following Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccines in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, 1990-2013.
“Includes 29 747 reports after Hib vaccines; 5179 (17%) were serious, including 896 reports of deaths. Median age was 6 months (range 0-1022 months). Sudden infant death syndrome was the stated cause of death in 384 (51%) of 749 death reports with autopsy/death certificate records.”

🛑 Beta-tryptase and quantitative mast-cell increase in a sudden infant death following hexavalent immunization.
“A fatal case of a 3-month-old female infant, who died within 24 h of vaccination with hexavalent vaccine is presented. Clinical data, post-mortem findings (acute pulmonary oedema, acute pulmonary emphysema), quali-quantitative data collected from immunohistochemical staining (degranulating mast cells) and laboratory analysis with a high level of beta-tryptase in serum, 43.3 microg/l, allows us to conclude that acute respiratory failure likely due to post hexavalent immunization-related shock was the cause of death.”

🛑 [Complications of pertussis immunization (author transl)].
“16 cases of neurological disease and/or death shortly after pertussis immunization are reported. Eight patients had convulsions, six with ensuing permanent defects. Severe polymyositis was observed in one case. Five infants died 12 h to 4 days after vaccination: two after acute encephalopathy and three in the form of a sudden unexpected death (SID). In two fatal cases the morphological changes in the brain corresponded to those of pertussis encephalopathy: neuronal degeneration in various parts of the cortex, especially in the region of the ammons horn, and in the cerebellum. There were no signs of inflammation. Three cases underwent forensic autopsy and death was attributed to bronchopulmonary infection. Complete neuropathological work-up was only done in one case, in which the brain was normal. The critique of episodical reports and the demand for prospective studies is appreciated. Knowledge of all possible forms of complications, however, is indispensable for future investigations. Polymyositis and SID have so far not been listed as abnormal reactions to immunization. The majority of our cases became known accidentally from hospital sheets or from discussions with collegues. For a detection of all possible cases a greater awareness of doctors for the problem of pertussis immunization appears necessary. Only another 23 cases have been reported to the health authorities of the state of Lower Saxony during the last 6 to 7 years. Of those, nine were either harmless reactions or diseases probably unrelated to vaccination. Two were cases of SID, 12 and 72 h after vaccination. It is concluded that only a minor proportion of possible complications is presently reported to the health authorities.”

Deaths Reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, United States, 1997-2013.
“RESULTS: VAERS received 2149 death reports, most (n = 1469 [68.4%]) in children. Median age was 0.5 years (range, 0-100 years); males accounted for 1226 (57%) reports. The total annual number of death reports generally decreased during the latter part of the study period. Most common causes of death among 1244 child reports with available death certificates/autopsy reports included sudden infant death syndrome (n = 544 [44%]), asphyxia (n = 74 [6.0%]), septicemia (n = 61 [4.9%]), and pneumonia (n = 57 [4.6%]). Among 526 adult reports, most common causes of death included diseases of the circulatory (n = 247 [46.9%]) and respiratory systems (n = 77 [14.6%]), certain infections and parasitic diseases (n = 62 [11.8%]), and malignant neoplasms (n = 20 [3.8%]). For child death reports, 79.4% received &gt;1 vaccine on the same day. Inactivated influenza vaccine given alone was most commonly associated with death reports in adults (51.4%).”

The epidemiology of fatalities reported to the vaccine adverse event reporting system 1990-1997.
“RESULTS: A total of 1266 fatalities were reported to VAERS during July 1990 through June 1997. The number of death reports peaked in 1992-1993 and then declined. The overall median age of cases was 0.4 years, with a range of 1 day to 104 years. Nearly half of the deaths were attributed to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).”

🛑 Neonatal deaths after hepatitis B vaccine: the vaccine adverse event reporting system, 1991-1998.
“RESULTS: Of 1771 neonatal reports, there were 18 deaths in 8 boys and 9 girls (1 patient unclassified). The mean age at vaccination for these 18 cases was 12 days (range, 1-27 days); median time from vaccination to onset of symptoms was 2 days (range, 0-20 days); and median time from symptoms to death was 0 days (range, 0-15 days). The mean birth weight of the neonates (n = 15) was 3034 g (range, 1828-4678 g). The causes of death for the 17 autopsied cases were sudden infant death syndrome for 12, infection for 3, and 1 case each of intracerebral hemorrhage, accidental suffocation, and congenital heart disease.”

Preparation for global introduction of inactivated poliovirus vaccine: safety evidence from the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, 2000-12.
“Of the 41,792 adverse event reports submitted, 39,568 (95%) were for children younger than 7 years. 38,381 of the reports for children in this age group (97%) were for simultaneous vaccination with IPV and other vaccines (most commonly pneumococcal and acellular pertussis vaccines), whereas standalone IPV vaccines accounted for 0·5% of all reports. 34,880 reports were for non-serious events (88%), 3905 reports were for non-fatal serious events (10%), and 783 reports were death reports (2%). Injection-site erythema was the most commonly coded term for non-serious events (29%), and pyrexia for non-fatal serious events (38%). Most deaths (96%) were in children aged 12 months or younger; most (52%) had sudden infant death syndrome as the reported cause of death.”

Revisiting the possibility of serious adverse events from the whole cell pertussis vaccine: were metabolically vulnerable children at risk?
“In the early 1980’s concerns about the safety of the whole cell pertussis vaccine in the United States resulted in declining vaccination rates and the withdrawal of multiple vaccine providers from the market. While the possibility of inflammation and febrile reactions to the vaccine were acknowledged by public health authorities, parents also claimed the vaccine was associated with sudden infant death syndrome and encephalopathy. Epidemiological studies examining this question, however, consistently failed to identify an association. We argue that these reactions may have occurred in metabolically vulnerable children, specifically those with defects in fatty acid oxidation. In these children the combination of anorexia and fever that could be caused by the vaccine may have resulted in hypoglycemic episodes and possibly death. We believe that this association was not detected because these conditions were not recognized at the time and because these conditions are uncommon. Nevertheless, at a population level, enough events could have occurred to cause concern amongst parents.”

Simultaneous sudden infant death syndrome.
“Twin girls (3.5-month-old) were found dead by their mother in their crib, both in supine position. The infants were identical twins and delivered at a hospital by cesarean section. Both infants were healthy and did not have any serious medical history. Two days prior to the incident, the twins had received the second dose of oral polio, DPT and the first dose of hepatitis B vaccines and they had fever on the first day of the vaccination and been given teaspoonful of acetaminophen.”

🛑 Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) shortly after hexavalent vaccination: another pathology in suspected SIDS?
“Herein we report the case of a 3-month-old female infant dying suddenly and unexpectedly shortly after being given a hexavalent vaccination. Examination of the brainstem on serial sections revealed bilateral hypoplasia of the arcuate nucleus. The cardiac conduction system presented persistent fetal dispersion and resorptive degeneration. This case offers a unique insight into the possible role of hexavalent vaccine in triggering a lethal outcome in a vulnerable baby. Any case of sudden unexpected death occurring perinatally and in infancy, especially soon after a vaccination, should always undergo a full necropsy study according to our guidelines.”

                                Adventitious agents in viral vaccines: Lessons learned from 4 case studies
“The four cases are: a) SV40 in polio vaccines; b) bacteriophage in measles and polio vaccines; c) reverse transcriptase in measles and mumps vaccines; and d) porcine circovirus and porcine circovirus DNA sequences in rotavirus vaccines.”

ð Association between SV40 and non-Hodgkinâs lymphoma.
“Millions of people worldwide were inadvertently exposed to live simian virus 40 (SV40) between 1955 and 1963 through immunization with SV40-contaminated polio vaccines. Although the prevalence of SV40 infections in humans is not known, numerous studies suggest that SV40 is a pathogen resident in the human population today. SV40 is a potent DNA tumor virus that is known to induce primary brain cancers, bone cancers, mesotheliomas, and lymphomas in laboratory animals.”

Donât ignore the risk of vaccine contamination
“Sir, Your News and Opinion articles about alleged contamination of vaccines should serve as a warning against over-optimism.
These articles highlight the failure to show any evidence for contamination of Wistar Institute polio vaccine stocks by human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV/SIV), and you appeal for a truce. But â although Edward Hooper is quoted as saying that “vaccine samples released did not include any from batches prepared for use in Africa” â lymphocytes have been detected in other polio vaccines. Half of the vervet monkeys in Southern Africa are SIV positive; these animals were used for preparing early polio vaccines.
Considering the many millions of vaccine doses prepared in primary vervet monkey kidney cultures over a 30-year period, it is inconceivable that some SIV did not contaminate many cultures. By the same yardstick, simian virus 40 (SV40) contaminated millions of doses of poliovirus vaccine until the animals were screened for this tumour virus.
Edward Hooper and others surely do not intend to undermine the polio vaccine efforts. What is needed is a new awareness of the need for caution â remembering the example of BSE â in view of the current impetus towards xenotransplantation and the accompanying danger of contamination. Our aim should be to improve our vaccines, not to undermine public confidence in them.”

Human and animal vaccine contaminations.
“However, since vaccine preparation involves the use of materials of biological origin, vaccines are subject to contamination by micro-organisms. In fact, vaccine contamination has occurred; a historical example of vaccine contamination, for example, can be found in the early days of development of the smallpox vaccine. The introduction of new techniques of vaccine virus production on cell cultures has lead to safer vaccines, but has not completely removed the risk of virus contamination. There are several examples of vaccine contamination, for example, contamination of human vaccines against poliomyelitis by SV40 virus from the use of monkey primary renal cells. Several veterinary vaccines have been contaminated by pestiviruses from foetal calf serum. These incidents have lead industry to change certain practices and regulatory authorities to develop more stringent and detailed requirements. But the increasing number of target species for vaccines, the diversity of the origin of biological materials and the extremely high number of known and unknown viruses and their constant evolution represent a challenge to vaccine producers and regulatory authorities.”

ð Oral polio vaccine and human cancer: a reassessment of SV40 as a contaminant based upon legal documents.
“The confirmation of the removal by one drug manufacturer, Lederle, has been made public at an international symposium in January 1997, where its representatives stated that all of Lederleâs seeds had been tested and screened to assure that it was free from SV40 virus. However, in litigation involving the Lederle oral polio vaccine, the manufacturerâs internal documents failed to reveal such removal in all of the seeds. The absence of confirmatory testing of the seeds, as well as testimony of a Lederle manager, indicate that this claim of removal of SV40 and the testing for SV40 in all the seeds cannot be fully substantiated. These legal documents and testimonyc indicate that the scientific community should not be content with prior assumptions that SV40 could not have been in the oral polio vaccine.”

ð Polio, hepatitis B and AIDS: an integrative theory on a possible vaccine induced pandemic.
“The hypothesis that simian virus 40 (SV40) infected polio vaccines may be linked to the evolution of acquired immunodeficiency disorder (AIDS), and certain cancers, has been advanced. Most recently, investigators discussed the likelihood of gene-reshuffling following SV40 infection as a precursor to acquired immune dysfunction. Findings of recent SV40 infections in four children born after 1982 suggest infections were transmitted vertically along gene lines. Earlier observations proved activation of a retrovirus gene by a hepatitis B virus (HBV) protein. This paper proposes a new integrative theory on the origin of AIDS. It advances the possibility of genetic recombinations with oncogene activation by HBV involving simian viruses that likely infected polio vaccinated blood donors to the initial hepatitis B (HB) vaccine trials conducted on gay men in New York City and Ugandan Blacks in the early to mid-1970s. The socio-economic and even military ramifications associated with this politically challenging thesis are discussed.”

Polio vaccines and the origin of AIDS.
“In particular, it is now known that the early polio vaccines were contaminated with at least one monkey virus, SV40. The transfer of monkey viruses to man via contaminated vaccines is particularly relevant to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), since the causative agent of AIDS, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is thought to be derived from a simian precursor virus. Furthermore, human infection with this virus appears to be a relatively recent event. We hypothesize that the AIDS pandemic may have originated with a contaminated polio vaccine that was administered to inhabitants of Equatorial Africa from 1957 to 1959. The mechanism of evolution of HIV from this vaccine remains to be determined.”

Simian cytomegalovirus and contamination of oral poliovirus vaccines.
“In the 1950s the use of primary rhesus macaque kidney cultures to propagate poliovirus for vaccine production led to the contamination of vaccines with simian virus 40 (SV40). African green monkey kidney (AGMK) cultures free of SV40 were used as an alternative cell substrate for vaccine manufacture. In this study we evaluate oral poliovirus seeds, vaccine bulks and vaccines themselves for the presence of a common contaminant of AGMK cultures, simian cytomegalovirus (SCMV). Using sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques, nearly half of the samples analysed were found to be contaminated with SCMV sequences. However, vaccine bulks, positive by PCR for SCMV failed to show any evidence of infectious virus in these studies. One poliovirus vaccine and one seed, propagated on rhesus macaque kidney cultures were found to be positive for the rhesus monkey CMV by PCR.”

Some oral poliovirus vaccines were contaminated with infectious SV40 after 1961.
“Some polio vaccines prepared from 1954 to 1961 were contaminated with infectious SV40. It has been assumed that all polio vaccines were SV40 free in the United States after 1961 and in other countries after 1962. Following a WHO requirement that was prompted by the detection of SV40 in some human tumors, we conducted a multilaboratory study to test for SV40 polio vaccines prepared after 1961. Vaccine samples from 13 countries and the WHO seed were initially tested by PCR. The possible presence of intact and/or infectious SV40 DNA in PCR-positive samples was tested by transfection and infection of permissive CV-1 cells. All results were verified by immunohistochemistry, cloning, and sequencing. All the vaccines were SV40 free, except for vaccines from a major eastern European manufacturer that contained infectious SV40. We determined that the procedure used by this manufacturer to inactivate SV40 in oral poliovirus vaccine seed stocks based on heat inactivation in the presence of MgCl2 did not completely inactivate SV40. These SV40-contaminated vaccines were produced from early 1960s to about 1978 and were used throughout the world. Our findings underscore the potential risks of using primary monkey cells for preparing poliovirus vaccines, because of the possible contamination with SV40 or other monkey viruses, and emphasize the importance of using well-characterized cell substrates that are free from adventitious agents. Moreover, our results indicate possible geographic differences in SV40 exposure and offer a possible explanation for the different percentage of SV40-positive tumors detected in some laboratories.”

[SV40 as a possible cofactor in the etiopathogenesis of mesothelioma and other human tumors].
“Simian virus 40 (SV40) has been introduced into the human population with contaminated polio vaccines between 1955 and 1963. Previous research conducted by southern blot hybridization and recent analysis by PCR have shown the presence of SW0 sequences in human brain tumors, mesotheliomas and osteosarcomas as well as in normal tissues such as blood and sperm fluids. SV40 RNA and T antigen were detected in the same tissues. All the samples were coinfected by BK Virus (BKV), suggesting that BKV may have a helper function for SV40 replication in human cells. The presence of SV40 in human tumors suggests that the virus may be a cofactor in the etiopathogenesis of human neoplasia. In addition, blood and semen may represent the vectors for transmission of SV40 by horizontal infection in the human population.”

Origins of and solutions for neonatal medication-dispensing errors.
“In 2008, there were five cases in which look-alike or sound-alike neonatal medication-dispensing errors occurred at our institution. A mix-up between neonatal and adult or pediatric products occurred in four of the five cases. Three of the five errors resulted in near misses with the potential to cause harm. The other two errors reached the patients but did not cause harm. The medication mix-ups involved adult and neonatal phytonadione injectable emulsion, sodium citrate injection and vancomycin-heparin combination injection, adult tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis and infant diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccines, Haemophilus B and DTaP vaccines, and cisatracurium and vecuronium.”

Although neurological complications have been described after tetanus vaccinations, they are rare. The authors report a case of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) in a 28-year-old pregnant woman at a gestational age of 10 weeks, admitted 15 days after a tetanus vaccination, with spastic tetraplegia and sphincter disturbances. Corticosteroid treatment led to partial recovery of the neurological deficit. Differential diagnosis of infectious and demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system is difficult in view of clinical and laboratory aspects of post-vaccination ADEM. Without any specific diagnostic markers, the clinical examination, magnetic resonance imaging and negative etiological findings were key to this diagnosis. Medical staff must bear in mind the possible complications of this vaccine.

The committee found that the evidence favored acceptance of a causal relation between diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome and brachial neuritis, between measles vaccine and anaphylaxis, between oral polio vaccine and Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome, and between unconjugated Hib vaccine and susceptibility to Hib disease. The committee found that the evidence established causality between diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and anaphylaxis, between measles vaccine and death from measles vaccine-strain viral infection, between measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and thrombocytopenia and anaphylaxis, between oral polio vaccine and poliomyelitis and death from polio vaccine-strain viral infection, and between hepatitis B vaccine and anaphylaxis.

ð Tetanus vaccine may be laced with anti-fertility drug. International / developing countries.
“A priest, president of Human Life International (HLI) based in Maryland, has asked Congress to investigate reports of women in some developing countries unknowingly receiving a tetanus vaccine laced with the anti-fertility drug human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). If it is true, he wants Congress to publicly condemn the mass vaccinations and to cut off funding to UN agencies and other involved organizations. The natural hormone hCG is needed to maintain pregnancy. The hormone would produce antibodies against hCG to prevent pregnancy. In the fall of 1994, the Pro Life Committee of Mexico was suspicious of the protocols for the tetanus toxoid campaign because they excluded all males and children and called for multiple injections of the vaccine in only women of reproductive age. Yet, one injection provides protection for at least 10 years. The Committee had vials of the tetanus vaccine analyzed for hCG. It informed HLI about the tetanus toxoid vaccine. HLI then told its World Council members and HLI affiliates in more than 60 countries. Similar tetanus vaccines laced with hCG have been uncovered in the Philippines and in Nicaragua. In addition to the World Health Organization (WHO), other organizations involved in the development of an anti-fertility vaccine using hCG include the UN Population Fund, the UN Development Programme, the World Bank, the Population Council, the Rockefeller Foundation, the US National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, and Uppsala, Helsinki, and Ohio State universities. The priest objects that, if indeed the purpose of the mass vaccinations is to prevent pregnancies, women are uninformed, unsuspecting, and unconsenting victims.”

[Post-licensure safety surveillance for Prevenar 13(Â®) in France].
“RESULTS: In 4 years and 4 months, 376 AEs, including 252 severe (67%), were recorded, 83 of which occurred following an injection of Prevenar 13(Â®) alone: 39 cutaneous AEs, 16 neurological AEs, four cases of collapse or shock, nine cases of fever, and one of thrombocytopenia. For the serious AEs, the outcome was favorable in 88% of cases and none of the 12 reported deaths were attributed to a side effect of vaccination. Fifty-nine cases of pneumococcal disease that suggest an ineffective vaccine were reported, but only 16 can be considered as a real failure of the vaccination.”

Vaccinations and secondary immune thrombocytopenia with antiphospholipid antibodies by human papillomavirus vaccine.
“A 13-year-old girl developed immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and concomitant positive antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) following vaccination with a quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. During the course of a disease, she developed clinical manifestation with bleeding and she was treated with intravenous immunoglobulins. Consequently, the number of her platelets remained critically low and she was put on corticosteroids and rituximab. Since then, her platelet count remain within the normal range, but her aPL are still present.

“In some cases, adjuvants may trigger generalized autoimmune response, resulting in multiple auto-antibodies, but sometimes they can reproduce human autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren syndrome, autoimmune thyroiditis and antiphospholipid syndrome and may provide insights about the potential adverse effects of adjuvants.”

🛑 An unmasking phenomenon in an observational post-licensure safety study of adolescent girls and young women.
“Our recent experience in a post-licensure safety study of autoimmune conditions following the quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine in 189,629 girls and young women ages 9-26 years led us to question the adequacy of the exclusion of Day 0 events to prevent the erroneous association of prevalent conditions with vaccination. Of the 18 confirmed cases of Graves’ disease diagnosed in days 1-60 following vaccination, only 6 cases appeared to be truly new onset. Among the remaining 12 cases, 2 cases had abnormal thyroid stimulating hormone or thyroxine labs drawn prior to or on Day 0 but had no documented pre-existing symptoms. The other 10 cases had mention of symptoms of hyperthyroidism referencing a period prior to first HPV-4 dose. This ‘unmasking’ phenomenon, due to health care visits that include vaccination and new workups of preexisting symptoms, may not be adequately controlled through the exclusion of Day 0 events.”

[Demyelinating disease and vaccination of the human papillomavirus].
“CASE REPORTS: We describe the cases of four young women that developed demyelinating disease after the vaccination of the HPV, with a rank of time between the administration of the dose and the development of the clinical of seven days to a month, with similar symptoms with the successive doses. We have described six episodes coinciding after the vaccination.
CONCLUSIONS: Have been described seizures, autoimmune disorders such as Guillain-Barre syndrome, transverse myelitis, or motor neuron disease, probably adverse effects following immunization by HPV vaccine. So we suggest that vaccine may trigger an immunological mechanism leading to demyelinating events, perhaps in predisposed young.”

Deaths Reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, United States, 1997-2013.
“RESULTS: VAERS received 2149 death reports, most (n = 1469 [68.4%]) in children. Median age was 0.5 years (range, 0-100 years); males accounted for 1226 (57%) reports. The total annual number of death reports generally decreased during the latter part of the study period. Most common causes of death among 1244 child reports with available death certificates/autopsy reports included sudden infant death syndrome (n = 544 [44%]), asphyxia (n = 74 [6.0%]), septicemia (n = 61 [4.9%]), and pneumonia (n = 57 [4.6%]). Among 526 adult reports, most common causes of death included diseases of the circulatory (n = 247 [46.9%]) and respiratory systems (n = 77 [14.6%]), certain infections and parasitic diseases (n = 62 [11.8%]), and malignant neoplasms (n = 20 [3.8%]). For child death reports, 79.4% received &gt;1 vaccine on the same day. Inactivated influenza vaccine given alone was most commonly associated with death reports in adults (51.4%).”

Neuropathology of vaccination in infants and children.
“AIMS: Documentation of clinical-pathological features of 37 infants/children whose parents alleged a relationship between vaccination and death or permanent central nervous system (CNS) damage, and sought compensation through the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.
SCOPE: Of the 5545 claims filed during the 10-year period (1990-1999), CNS tissue was available for evaluation by a pediatric neuropathologist in 37; 33 died and 4 had a biopsy or lobectomy. Most commonly implicated vaccines were DTP/DTaP, followed by MMR and IPV/OPV, but almost all of the vaccines currently given to infants/children were alleged to be responsible for the illness/death. No lesions were found in 5 of 37 (13.5%). The most frequent abnormality consisted of acute anoxic encephalopathy (14 of 37 - 37.8%), consequent to several different causes, such as positional asphyxia, cardio-respiratory arrest during status epilepticus, etc. The remaining children manifested other lesions, including inflammation (5 of 37 - 13.5%), vascular and developmental anomalies (4 each of 37 or 10.6%), cerebral edema and system degeneration (2 each of 37 or 5.4%), and one case of heavy metal exposure in a child living near an abandoned mine (2.2%).”

RotaTeq vaccine adverse events and policy considerations.
“RESULTS: From February 3, 2021 through July 31, 2007, a total of 160 (of the 165 reported) intussusception and 11 (of the 16 reported) Kawasaki disease adverse event reports were identified when RotaTeq was administered or co-administered with other vaccines. Time-trend analyses showed that there were significant increases in the total number of intussusception and Kawasaki disease adverse events entered into VAERS in comparison to previous years.
CONCLUSIONS: These observations, coupled with limited rotavirus disease burden, cost-effectiveness, and potential contact viral transmission concerns, raise serious questions regarding the use of RotaTeq in the US. Healthcare providers should diligently report adverse events following RotaTeq vaccination to VAERS, and those who have experienced a vaccine-associated adverse event should be made aware that they may be eligible for compensation from the no-fault National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP).”

Chickenpox attributable to a vaccine virus contracted from a vaccinee with zoster.
“Five months after 2 siblings were immunized with varicella vaccine, 1 developed zoster. Two weeks later the second sibling got a mild case of chicken pox. Virus isolated from the latter was found to be vaccine type. Thus, the vaccine strain was transmitted from the vaccinee with zoster to his sibling. Vaccinees who later develop zoster must be considered contagious.”

“We describe a death in a 15-mo-old girl who developed a varicella-like rash 20 d after varicella vaccination that lasted for 2 mo despite acyclovir treatment. The rash was confirmed to be due to vaccine-strain varicella-zoster virus (VZV).”

Live attenuated varicella vaccine: evidence that the virus is attenuated and the importance of skin lesions in transmission of varicella-zoster virus. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Varicella Vaccine Collaborative Study Group.
“To examine whether the live varicella vaccine virus is attenuated, we analyzed varicella vaccine-induced contact cases of clinical chickenpox in healthy siblings of immunized children with leukemia. A rash developed approximately 1 month later in 156 children with leukemia who had been vaccinated. Vaccine-type virus was isolated from 25 of these children. Of 88 known susceptible healthy siblings who were exposed to a vaccine with a rash and from whom follow-up information was available, there was evidence of infection in 15 (17%). Of 15 siblings with seroconversion, 11 (73%) also acquired a mild rash with an average of 38 lesions and no accompanying systemic symptoms. Vaccine-type virus was isolated from four of the contact siblings. Tertiary transmission was documented once. Contact siblings with seroconversion were protected during future household exposure to chickenpox, which occurred in four instances.”

Secondary transmission of varicella vaccine virus in a chronic care facility for children.
“A 16-year-old varicella-seronegative resident at a chronic care facility received varicella vaccine; 15 days later he developed severe varicella. Subsequently, a 13-year-old resident and a 39-year-old health care worker developed mild varicella. We demonstrate that vaccine-strain virus was transmitted to both persons, and that transmission included at least 2 variant vaccine strains.”

ð [Vaccines, biotechnology and their connection with induced abortion].
“Diploid cells (WI-38, MRC-5) vaccines have their origin in induced abortions. Among these vaccines we find the following: rubella, measles, mumps, rabies, polio, smallpox, hepatitis A, chickenpox, and herpes zoster. Nowadays, other abortion tainted vaccines cultivated on transformed cells (293, PER.C6) are in the pipeline: flu, Respiratory Syncytial and parainfluenza viruses, HIV, West Nile virus, Ebola, Marburg and Lassa, hepatitis B and C, foot and mouth disease, Japanese encephalitis, dengue, tuberculosis, anthrax, plague, tetanus and malaria. The same method is used for the production of monoclonal antibodies and other proteins, gene therapy and genomics. Technology enables us to develop the aforementioned products without resorting to induced abortion. Full disclosure of the cell origin in the labelling of vaccines and other products must be supported. There are vaccines from non-objectionable sources which should be made available to the public. When no alternative vaccines exist, ethical research must be promoted. Non-objectionable sources in the production of monoclonal antibodies, gene therapy and genomics must be encouraged. It is not be consistent to abstain from products originated in embryonic stem cells and at the same time approve of products obtained from induced abortions. It is of paramount importance to avoid that induced abortion technology seeps into every field of Medicine.”

Adjuvants- and vaccines-induced autoimmunity: animal models.
“In some cases, adjuvants may trigger generalized autoimmune response, resulting in multiple auto-antibodies, but sometimes they can reproduce human autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren syndrome, autoimmune thyroiditis and antiphospholipid syndrome and may provide insights about the potential adverse effects of adjuvants.”

Endogenous retroviruses as potential hazards for vaccines.
“Retroviruses are classified as exogenous or endogenous according to their mode of transmission. Generally, endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are not pathogenic in their original hosts; however, some ERVs induce diseases. In humans, a novel gammaretrovirus was discovered in patients with prostate cancer or chronic fatigue syndrome. This virus was closely related to xenotropic murine leukemia virus (X-MLV) and designated as xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV). The origin and transmission route of XMRV are still unknown at present; however, XMRV may be derived from ERVs of rodents because X-MLVs are ERVs of inbred and wild mice. Many live attenuated vaccines for animals are manufactured by using cell lines from animals, which are known to produce infectious ERVs; however, the risks of infection by ERVs from xenospecies through vaccination have been ignored. This brief review gives an overview of ERVs in cats, the potential risks of ERV infection by vaccination, the biological characteristics of RD-114 virus (a feline ERV), which possibly contaminates vaccines for companion animals, and the methods for detection of infectious RD-114 virus.

Human and animal vaccine contaminations.
“However, since vaccine preparation involves the use of materials of biological origin, vaccines are subject to contamination by micro-organisms. In fact, vaccine contamination has occurred; a historical example of vaccine contamination, for example, can be found in the early days of development of the smallpox vaccine. The introduction of new techniques of vaccine virus production on cell cultures has lead to safer vaccines, but has not completely removed the risk of virus contamination. There are several examples of vaccine contamination, for example, contamination of human vaccines against poliomyelitis by SV40 virus from the use of monkey primary renal cells. Several veterinary vaccines have been contaminated by pestiviruses from foetal calf serum. These incidents have lead industry to change certain practices and regulatory authorities to develop more stringent and detailed requirements. But the increasing number of target species for vaccines, the diversity of the origin of biological materials and the extremely high number of known and unknown viruses and their constant evolution represent a challenge to vaccine producers and regulatory authorities.”

Human contacts with oral rabies vaccine baits distributed for wildlife rabies management-Ohio, 2012.
“Baits laden with oral rabies vaccines are important for the management of wildlife rabies in the United States. In August 2012, the Wildlife Services program of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service began a field trial involving limited distribution of a new oral rabies vaccine bait in five states, including Ohio. The vaccine consisted of live recombinant human adenovirus type 5 vector, expressing rabies virus glycoprotein (AdRG1.3) (Onrab). A previously used oral rabies vaccine consisting of a live recombinant vaccinia vector, expressing rabies virus glycoprotein (V-RG) (Raboral V-RG), was distributed in other areas of Ohio. To monitor human contacts and potential vaccine virus exposure, surveillance was conducted by the Ohio Department of Health, local Ohio health agencies, and CDC. During August 23-September 7, 2012, a total of 776,921 baits were distributed in Ohio over 4,379 square miles (11,341 square kilometers). During August 24-September 12, a total of 89 baits were reported found by the general public, with 55 human contacts with baits identified (some contacts involved more than one bait). In 27 of the 55 human contacts, the bait was not intact, and a barrier (e.g., gloves) had not been used to handle the bait, leaving persons at risk for vaccine exposure and vaccine virus infection. However, no adverse events were reported. Continued surveillance of human contacts with oral rabies vaccine baits and public warnings to avoid contact with baits are needed because of the potential for vaccine virus infection.”

🛑 Human Illness Associated with Use of Veterinary Vaccines 
“Is human exposure to veterinary vaccines a potential public health concern? There is currently limited understanding of the incidence of exposure of individuals to veterinary vaccines or of the consequences of such exposure. In addition, the potential for exposure and for adverse consequences secondary to exposure to veterinary vaccines may be increasing. The increased development and use of veterinary vaccines (including live vaccines), the increased aerosol administration of vaccines, and the increased proportion of individuals in the United States who are immunosuppressed and who may be exposed to these vaccines or to animals shedding the vaccine strains suggest that increased vigilance may be warranted.”

Incidence of adverse events in ferrets vaccinated with distemper or rabies vaccine: 143 cases (1995-2001).
“…veterinarians who vaccinate ferrets should be prepared to treat anaphylactic reactions.” 
“Adverse events developed within 25 minutes after vaccination in 13 ferrets. One ferret developed an adverse event after receiving a distemper and a rabies vaccine simultaneously and developed a second adverse event the following year after receiving the rabies vaccine alone. Therefore, a total of 14 adverse events were identified. All adverse events were an anaphylactic reaction characterized by generalized hyperemia, hypersalivation, and vomiting. Ten of the 14 anaphylactic reactions occurred after ferrets received both vaccines, 3 occurred after ferrets received the distemper vaccine alone, and 1 occurred after a ferret received the rabies vaccine alone. Incidences of adverse events after administration of both vaccines, the distemper vaccine alone, and the rabies vaccine alone were 5.6, 5.9, and 5.6%, respectively. Ferrets that had an anaphylactic reaction were significantly older at the time of vaccination than were ferrets that did not.”

Mortality and morbidity among military personnel and civilians during the 1930s and World War II from transmission of hepatitis during yellow fever vaccination: systematic review.
“During World War II, nearly all US and Allied troops received yellow fever vaccine. Until May 1942, it was both grown and suspended in human serum. In April 1942, major epidemics of hepatitis occurred in US and Allied troops who had received yellow fever vaccine. A rapid and thorough investigation by the US surgeon general followed, and a directive was issued discontinuing the use of human serum in vaccine production. The large number of cases of hepatitis caused by the administration of this vaccine could have been avoided. Had authorities undertaken a thorough review of the literature, they would have discovered published reports, as early as 1885, of postvaccination epidemics of hepatitis in both men and horses. It would take 4 additional decades of experiments and epidemiological research before viruses of hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E were identified, their modes of transmission understood, and their genomes sequenced.”

Postinflammatory sarcoma in cats.
“Histological examination of 38 nodular formations extirpated from the site of vaccine administration to cats disclosed 25 cases of sarcoma and 13 of granuloma. Average age of the cats bearing sarcoma was 8.75 years whereas granuloma occurred at average age of 1.9 year. This age-relationship of the lesions, as well as their similar morphologic features indicated a progression of chronic inflammatory changes to tumors. Similar tumors were diagnosed in one cat with “posttraumatic ocular sarcoma” and in the uterus of female-cat with long-standing pyometra. These two cats were 15 and 8 years old, respectively. Experimental study of local reaction 21 days after administration of commercial, lipid-adjuvanted vaccine revealed in young cats (age 9 months) a reaction to immunogen, whereas in old animals (age 10 to 15 years) there was a reaction to foreign material. The data suggest that chronic inflammation and age-related immunodeficiency are instrumental in pathogenesis of the vaccine-associated sarcoma.”

Postpartum live virus vaccination: lessons from veterinary medicine.
“Pregnant rubella-susceptible women are often revaccinated during the postpartum period with the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella vaccine (MMR). It is known that the rubella virus from vaccine is secreted in breast milk and persists in the nose and throat for up to 28 days but it is not known whether the measles and mumps viruses are similarly secreted. It is probable the measles virus from vaccine is.”

Post-vaccinal distemper encephalitis in two Border Collie cross littermates.
“CASE HISTORY: One 4.5-month-old male Border Collie cross presented with aggression and seizures in October 2006. A 16-month-old, female, spayed Border Collie cross presented with hypersalivation and a dropped jaw and rapidly became stuporous in September 2007. The dogs were littermates and developed acute neurological signs 5 and 27 days, respectively, after vaccination with different modified live vaccines containing canine distemper virus.
HISTOPATHOLOGICAL FINDINGS: Sections of brain in both dogs showed evidence of encephalitis mainly centred on the grey matter of brainstem nuclei, where there was extensive and intense parenchymal and perivascular infiltration of histiocytes and lymphocytes. Intra-nuclear and intra-cytoplasmic inclusions typical of distemper were plentiful and there was abundant labelling for canine distemper virus using immunohistochemistry.
DIAGNOSIS: Post-vaccinal canine distemper.
CLINCIAL RELEVANCE: Post-vaccinal canine distemper has mainly been attributed to virulent vaccine virus, but it may also occur in dogs whose immunologic nature makes them susceptible to disease induced by a modified-live vaccine virus that is safe and protective for most dogs.”

[Postvaccinal fatal Streptococcus zooepidemicus necrotizing fasciitis in a young dog: a case report].
“A 2.5-years-old female mongrel dog was routinely subcutaneously vaccinated. A few hours later mental dullness was noticed by the owner progressing into stupor the next day and resulting in a comatose state and death within 48 hours after vaccination. At post mortem examination, which was extended with histology and bacteriology, a necrotizing fasciitis and bacteremia caused by Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus were established. In the isolated Streptococcus strain four different superantigens were demonstrated that appeared to be able to produce exotoxins in vitro. Therefore, it is concluded that the minor skin trauma caused by vaccination enabled this strain to gain access to the subcutaneous tissue and to induce a necrotizing fasciitis. This process was complicated with a bacterial septicemia leading to death of the dog within 48 hours.”

Reemergence of vaccinia virus during Zoonotic outbreak, Pará State, Brazil.
“In 2010, vaccinia virus caused an outbreak of bovine vaccinia that affected dairy cattle and rural workers in Pará State, Brazil. Genetic analyses identified the virus as distinct from BeAn58058 vaccinia virus (identified in 1960s) and from smallpox vaccine virus strains. These findings suggest spread of autochthonous group 1 vaccinia virus in this region.”

Testing for viral contaminants of veterinary vaccines in Hungary.
“The safety of veterinary vaccines is of paramount importance and it is significantly jeopardised by extraneous agents such as bacteria, mycoplasma, Chlamydia and viruses. Several critical steps of vaccine manufacture involve a potential risk of viral contamination. Viruses, as extraneous, agents can be divided into two main groups. Group 1 agents, such as Pestivirus, chicken anaemia virus (CAV), and egg drop syndrome virus (EDSV) are well-known to manufacturers and authorities. Compendial detection methods, clear guidelines and legislation have been established to minimise the risk of contamination with these agents. Contrary to group 1, group 2 agents like Torque Teno virus (TTV) or RD114, a replication-competent feline gamma-retrovirus, have only recently been recognised and their role as contaminants needs further investigation. Randomly selected veterinary vaccines used between 1992 and 2009 were tested by nucleic acid amplification for CAV, EDSV, and TTV. Pestivirus contamination was examined in 33 vaccines used between 1996 and 2006 and a further 27 vaccines used between 2007 and 2009 based on random selection of these vaccines. In addition to random tests done on vaccines used from 2007 on, 12 batches of live Aujeszky’s disease vaccines submitted to our laboratory for Official Control Authority Batch Release (OCABR) were also tested for Pestivirus.”

The unexpected discovery of Brucella abortus Buck 19 vaccine in goats from Ecuador underlines the importance of biosecurity measures.
“All results were negative, apart from a single sample, obtained from a serologically positive goat in Quito, that was positive for Brucella abortus strain 19 (B19). Several hypotheses are forwarded concerning this unexpected result. The most likely hypothesis is the possible accidental use of a needle, previously used for vaccination of cattle with the said vaccine, for the administration of drug treatment to the goat. This hypothesis underlines the necessity of biosecurity measures to prevent this type of accidents.”

The use of fetal bovine serum: ethical or scientific problem?
“Fetal bovine serum (FBS) is a common component of animal cell culture media. It is harvested from bovine fetuses taken from pregnant cows during slaughter. FBS is commonly harvested by means of a cardiac puncture without any form of anaesthesia. Fetuses are probably exposed to pain and/or discomfort, so the current practice of fetal blood harvesting is inhumane. Apart from moral concerns, several scientific and technical problems exist with regard to the use of FBS in cell culture. Efforts should be made to reduce the use of FBS or, preferably, to replace it with synthetic alternatives.”

ð Childhood cancer, intramuscular vitamin K, and pethidine given during labour.
“…but there was a significant association (p = 0.002) with intramuscular vitamin K (odds ratio 1.97, 95% confidence interval 1.3 to 3.0) when compared with oral vitamin K or no vitamin K. There was no significantly increased risk for children who had been given oral vitamin K when compared with no vitamin K (odds ratio 1.15, 95% confidence interval 0.5 to 2.7). These results could not be accounted for by other factors associated with administration of intramuscular vitamin K, such as type of delivery or admission to a special care baby unit.”
“The only two studies so far to have examined the relation between childhood cancer and intramuscular vitamin K have shown similar results, and the relation is biologically plausible. The prophylactic benefits against haemorrhagic disease are unlikely to exceed the potential adverse effects from intramuscular vitamin K. Since oral vitamin K has major benefits but no obvious adverse effects this could be the prophylaxis of choice.”

Neonatal ergot poisoning: a persistent iatrogenic illness.
“Ergot toxicity in the newborn usually manifests itself as respiratory depression, cyanosis, oliguria, and seizures. Death is usually caused by respiratory failure. A limited number of neonatal cases have been reported worldwide, and almost all cases involved confusion of maternal methylergonovine with neonatal vitamin K.”

ð Oral versus intramuscular phytomenadione: safety and efficacy compared.
“Oral and intramuscular phytomenadione (vitamin K1) prophylaxis became an issue following the report of a potential carcinogenic effect of intramuscular but not oral phytomenadione prophylaxis. There is increasing evidence, however, that oral phytomenadione prophylaxis is less effective for the prevention of late vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB) than intramuscular prophylaxis. Following a report of an increased cancer risk after intramuscular phytomenadione, a series of papers on this issue appeared. Although an increased risk for solid tumours could almost certainly be excluded, a potential risk for acute lymphatic leukaemia in childhood could not be ruled out definitively. Almost all cases of late VKDB are preventable with intramuscular phytomenadione prophylaxis administered once at birth, whereas a single oral dose given at birth is much less effective. Repeated oral phytomenadione doses given to breast-fed infants either weekly (1 mg) or daily (25 microg) seem to be as effective as intramuscular phytomenadione prophylaxis. The efficacy of 3 oral 2mg doses with the new mixed micellar preparation (‘Konakion MMâ) remains to be established. Although a number of studies have failed to confirm a cancer risk with phytomenadione, these studies have been unable to rule out a risk definitely because absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. A meta-analysis of the available studies might provide 95% confidence intervals narrow enough to exclude even a small cancer risk with some certainty. Oral prophylaxis will probably be as safe as the intramuscular prophylaxis if given daily (25 microg) or weekly (1 mg).”

Origins of and solutions for neonatal medication-dispensing errors.
“In 2008, there were five cases in which look-alike or sound-alike neonatal medication-dispensing errors occurred at our institution. A mix-up between neonatal and adult or pediatric products occurred in four of the five cases. Three of the five errors resulted in near misses with the potential to cause harm. The other two errors reached the patients but did not cause harm. The medication mix-ups involved adult and neonatal phytonadione injectable emulsion, sodium citrate injection and vancomycin-heparin combination injection, adult tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis and infant diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccines, Haemophilus B and DTaP vaccines, and cisatracurium and vecuronium.”

An unusual mimicker of a sepsis outbreak: ergot intoxication.
“Methylergonovine (MEV) is a semi-synthetic ergot alkaloid used in the prevention and control of postpartum hemorrhage. This report describes 12 newborns born on the same day in a local country hospital in Turkey and developed sepsis-like symptoms and encephalopathy within the first 6 h of life due to accidental administration of MEV instead of vitamin K in the delivery room. The major features of MEV poisoning were lethargy (41.7%), seizure (75.0%), feeding intolerance (66.6%), hypoventilation (58.3%), irritability (25%), and peripheral circulatory abnormalities (58.3%). As a conclusion, clinical findings of ergot toxicity in newborns cannot be distinguished from infectious disease or neonatal encephalopathy.”

Why we need a clinical trial for vitamin K.
“Vitamin K is given to many babies born in the United Kingdom, but we still do not know if it has substantial hazards. Because the population exposed to vitamin K is very large even quite small hazards would involve many adverse events. It is therefore important to be able to put reasonably close bounds on the potential damage that vitamin K prophylaxis could cause. Past research has not allowed us to do this but a large randomised controlled clinical trial of vitamin K against no vitamin K, enrolling only infants at low risk of haemorrhagic disease, would do so. There is no question that vitamin K is a useful treatment in babies at highest risk of haemorrhagic disease: the question is whether the trend towards use of vitamin K in lower risk babies should be encouraged.”

Fever and multisystem organ failure associated with 17D-204 yellow fever vaccination: a report of four cases.
“In 1998, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was notified of three patients who developed severe illnesses days after yellow fever vaccination. A similar case occurred in 1996. All four patients were more than 63 years old.
METHODS: Vaccine strains of yellow fever virus, isolated from the plasma of two patients and the cerebrospinal fluid of one, were characterised by genomic sequencing. Clinical samples were subjected to neutralisation assays, and an immunohistochemical analysis was done on one sample of liver obtained at biopsy.
FINDINGS: The clinical presentations were characterised by fever, myalgia, headache, and confusion, followed by severe multisystemic illnesses. Three patients died. Vaccine-related variants of yellow fever virus were found in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of one vaccinee. The convalescent serum samples of two vaccinees showed antibody responses of at least 1:10240. Immunohistochemical assay of liver tissue showed yellow fever antigen in the Kuppfer cells of the liver sample.”

Mortality and morbidity among military personnel and civilians during the 1930s and World War II from transmission of hepatitis during yellow fever vaccination: systematic review.
“During World War II, nearly all US and Allied troops received yellow fever vaccine. Until May 1942, it was both grown and suspended in human serum. In April 1942, major epidemics of hepatitis occurred in US and Allied troops who had received yellow fever vaccine. A rapid and thorough investigation by the US surgeon general followed, and a directive was issued discontinuing the use of human serum in vaccine production. The large number of cases of hepatitis caused by the administration of this vaccine could have been avoided. Had authorities undertaken a thorough review of the literature, they would have discovered published reports, as early as 1885, of postvaccination epidemics of hepatitis in both men and horses. It would take 4 additional decades of experiments and epidemiological research before viruses of hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E were identified, their modes of transmission understood, and their genomes sequenced.”

Questions regarding the safety and duration of immunity following live yellow fever vaccination.
“We found that antiviral immunity may be lost in 1-in-3 to 1-in-5 individuals within 5 to 10 years after a single vaccination and that children may be at greater risk for primary vaccine failure. The safety profile of YFV-17D was compared to other licensed vaccines including oral polio vaccine (OPV) and the rotavirus vaccine, RotaShield, which have subsequently been withdrawn from the US and world market, respectively. Expert commentary: Based on these results and recent epidemiological data on vaccine failures (particularly evident at &gt;10 years after vaccination), we believe that current recommendations to no longer administer YFV-17D booster vaccination be carefully re-evaluated, and that further development of safer vaccine approaches should be considered.”

Current Safety Concerns with Human Papillomavirus Vaccine: A Cluster Analysis of Reports in VigiBaseÂ® (2017)
“Cluster analysis reveals additional reports of AEs following HPV vaccination that are serious in nature and describe symptoms that overlap those reported in cases from the recent safety signals (POTS, CRPS, and CFS), but which do not report explicit diagnoses. While the causal association between HPV vaccination and these AEs remains uncertain, more extensive analyses of spontaneous reports can better identify the relevant case series for thorough signal evaluation.”

ð LESSONS FROM THE SALK POLIO VACCINE: METHODS FOR AND RISKS OF RAPID TRANSLATION
“Regretfully, the story of polio vaccine was not without tragedy. In April 1955, soon after mass polio vaccination began in the United States, reports trickled in to the Surgeon General concerning atypical cases of paralytic polio. Several paralytic polio cases were reported in California in patients who had received the polio vaccine about a week earlier but the paralysis only affected the arm or leg in which they received the injection. Each of these cases occurred in polio vaccine produced by Cutter pharmaceutical company. The Surgeon General immediately pulled all Cutter polio vaccine, but it was too late; nearly 400,000 children had been inoculated with Cutter polio vaccine and 250 cases of atypical paralytic polio occurred. There were also reports of the Wyeth pharmaceutical company polio vaccine causing paralysis and death in several children in the northeastern United States.
It was soon discovered that some lots of Cutter and Wyeth polio vaccine were insufficiently inactivated with formalin leading to live polio virus in more than 100,000 doses. In fact, 16 lots of Cutter polio vaccine were retested and the first 6 lots produced were positive for live polio virus. These incidents demonstrated the lack of oversight and safeguards put into place before the vaccine was made so widely available.”
